    <title>Playing with Colors</title>
    <para>This tutorial will show how to provide some color to the triangle from the previous
        tutorial. Instead of just giving the triangle a solid color, we will use two methods to
        provide it with varying color across its surface. The methods are to using the fragment's
        position to compute a color and to using per-vertex data to compute a color.</para>
    <section xml:id="FragPosition">
        <title>Fragment Position Display</title>
        <para>As we stated in the overview, part of the fragment's data includes the position of the
            fragment on the screen. Thus, if we want to vary the color of a triangle across its
            surface, We can access this data in our fragment shader and use it to compute the final
            color for that fragment. This is done in the <phrase role="propername">Fragment
                Position</phrase> tutorial, who's main file is
            <filename>FragPosition.cpp</filename>.</para>
        <para>In this tutorial, and all future ones, shaders will be loaded from files instead of
            hard-coded strings in the .cpp file. To support this, the framework has the
                <function>Framework::LoadShader</function> and
                <function>Framework::CreateProgram</function> functions. These work similarly to the
            previous tutorial's <function>CreateShader</function> and
                <function>CreateProgram</function>, except that <function>LoadShader</function>
            takes a filename instead of a shader file.</para>
        <para>The FragPosition tutorial loads two shaders, the vertex shader
                <filename>data/FragPosition.vert</filename> and the fragment shader
                <filename>data/FragPosition.frag</filename>. The vertex shader is identical to the
            one in the last tutorial. The fragment shader is very new, however:</para>
        <example>

            <programlisting language="glsl"><![CDATA[#version 330

out vec4 outputColor;

void main()
{
    float lerpValue = gl_FragCoord.y / 500.0f;
    
    outputColor = mix(vec4(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f),
        vec4(0.2f, 0.2f, 0.2f, 1.0f), lerpValue);

        </example>
        <para><varname>gl_FragCoord</varname> is a built-in variable that is only available in a
            fragment shader. It is a <classname>vec3</classname>, so it has an X, Y, and Z
            component. The X and Y values are in <emphasis>window</emphasis> coordinates, so the
            absolute value of these numbers will change based on the window's resolution. Recall
            that window coordinates put the origin at the bottom-left corner. So fragments along the
            bottom of the triangle would have a lower Y value than those at the top.</para>
        <para>The idea with this shader is that the color of a fragment will be based on the Y value
            of its window position. The 500.0f is the height of the window (unless you resize the
            window). The division in the first line of the function simply converts the Y position
            to the [0, 1] range, where 1 is at the top of the window and 0 is at the bottom.</para>
        <para>The second line uses this [0, 1] value to perform a linear interpolation between two
            colors. The <function>mix</function> function is one of the many,
                <emphasis>many</emphasis> standard functions that the OpenGL Shading Language
            provides. Many of these functions, like <function>mix</function>, are vectorized. That
            is, some of their parameters can be vectors, and when they are, they will perform their
            operations on each component of the vector simultaneously. In this case, the
            dimensionality of the first two parameters must match.</para>
        <para>The <function>mix</function> function performs a linear interpolation. It will return
            exactly the first parameter if the third parameter is 0, and it will return exactly the
            second parameter if the third parameter is 1. If the third parameter is between 0 and 1,
            it will return a value between the two other parameters, based on the third
            parameter.</para>
        <note>
            <para>The third parameter to <function>mix</function> must be on the range [0, 1].
                However, GLSL will not check this or do the clamping for you. If it is not on this
                range, the result of the <function>mix</function> function will be undefined.
                    <quote>Undefined</quote> is the OpenGL shorthand for, <quote>I do not know, but
                    it is probably not what you want.</quote></para>

        <para>We get the following image:</para>

        <title>Vertex Attributes</title>
        <para>Using the fragment position in a fragment shader is quite useful, but it is far from
            the best tool for controlling the color of triangles. A much more useful tool is to give
            each vertex a color explicitly. The <phrase role="propername">Vertex Colors</phrase>
            tutorial implements this; the main file for this tutorial is
                <filename>VertexColors.cpp</filename>.</para>
        <para>We want to affect the data being passed through the system. The sequence of events we
            want to happen is as follows.</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>For every position that we pass to a vertex shader, we want to pass a

            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>For every output position in the vertex shader, we also want to output a color

                <para>In the fragment shader, we want to receive an input color from the vertex

            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>You most likely have some serious questions about that sequence of events, notably
            about how steps 2 and 3 could possibly work. We'll get to that. We will follow the
            revised flow of data through the OpenGL pipeline.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Multiple Vertex Arrays and Attributes</title>
            <para>In order to accomplish the first step, we need to change our vertex array data.
                That data now looks like this:</para>
            <example>
                <title>New Vertex Array Data</title>
                <programlisting language="cpp"><![CDATA[const float vertexData[] = {
     0.0f,    0.5f, 0.0f, 1.0f,
     0.5f, -0.366f, 0.0f, 1.0f,
    -0.5f, -0.366f, 0.0f, 1.0f,
     1.0f,    0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f,
     0.0f,    1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f,
     0.0f,    0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,
};]]></programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>First, we need to understand what arrays of data look like at the lowest level. A
                single byte is the smallest addressible data in C/C++. A byte represents 8 bits (a
                bit can be 0 or 1), and it is a number on the range [0, 255]. A value of type
                    <type>float</type> requires 4 bytes worth of storage. Any <type>float</type>
                value is stored in 4 consecutive bytes of memory.</para>
            <para>A sequence of 4 floats, in GLSL parlance a <type>vec4</type>, is exactly that: a
                sequence of four floating-point values. Therefore, a <literal>vec4</literal> takes
                up 16 bytes, 4 <type>float</type>s times the size of a <type>float</type>.</para>
            <para>The <varname>vertexData</varname> variable is one large array of floats. The way
                we want to use it however is as two arrays. Each 4 floats is a single
                    <type>vec4</type>, and the first three <type>vec4</type>s represents the
                positions. The next 3 are the colors for the corresponding vertices.</para>
            <para>In memory, the <varname>vertexData</varname> array looks like this:</para>
            <figure>
                <title>Vertex Array Memory Map</title>
                <mediaobject>
                    <imageobject>
                        <imagedata fileref="MemoryDiagram.svg"/>
                    </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
            </figure>
            <para>The top two show the layout of the basic data types, and each box is a byte. The
                bottom diagram shows the layout of the entire array, and each box is a
                    <type>float</type>. The left half of the box represents the positions and the
                right half represents the colors.</para>
            <para>The first 3 sets of values are the three positions of the triangle, and the next 3
                sets of values are the three colors at these vertices. What we really have is two
                arrays that just happen to be adjacent to one another in memory. One starts at the
                memory address <literal>&amp;vertexData[0]</literal>, and the other starts at the
                memory address <literal>&amp;vertexData[12]</literal></para>
            <para>As with all vertex data, this is put into a buffer object. We have seen this code
                before:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Buffer Object Initialization</title>
                <programlisting language="cpp"><![CDATA[void InitializeVertexBuffer()
{
    glGenBuffers(1, &vertexBufferObject);
    
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertexBufferObject);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertexData), vertexData, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
}]]></programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>The code has not changed, because the sizes of the array is computed by the
                compiler with the <literal>sizeof</literal> directive. Since we added a few elements
                to the buffer, the computed size naturally grows bigger.</para>
            <para>Also, you may notice that the positions are different from prior tutorials. The
                original triangle, and the one that was used in the <phrase role="propername"
                    >Fragment Position</phrase> code, was a right triangle (one of the angles of the
                triangle is 90 degrees) that was isosceles (two of its three sides are the same
                length). This new triangle is an equilateral triangle (all three sides are the same
                length) centered at the origin.</para>
            <para>Recall from above that we are sending two pieces of data per-vertex: a position
                and a color. We have two arrays, one for each piece of data. They may happen to be
                adjacent to one another in memory, but this changes nothing; there are two arrays of
                data. We need to tell OpenGL how to get each of these pieces of data.</para>
            <para>This is done as follows:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Rendering the Scene</title>
                <programlisting language="cpp"><![CDATA[void display()
{
    glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    
    glUseProgram(theProgram);
    
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertexBufferObject);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);
    glVertexAttribPointer(0, 4, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, 0);
    glVertexAttribPointer(1, 4, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, (void*)48);
    
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
    
    glDisableVertexAttribArray(0);
    glDisableVertexAttribArray(1);
    glUseProgram(0);
    
    glutSwapBuffers();
    glutPostRedisplay();
}]]></programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>Since we have two pieces of data, we have two vertex attributes. For each
                attribute, we must call <function>glEnableVertexAttribArray</function> to enable
                that particular attribute. The first parameter is the attribute location set by the
                    <literal>layout(location)</literal> field for that attribute in the vertex
                shader.</para>
            <para>Then, we call <function>glVertexAttribPointer</function> for each of the attribute
                arrays we want to use. The only difference in the two calls are which attribute
                location to send the data to and the last parameter. The last parameter is the byte
                offset into the buffer of where the data for this attribute starts. This offset, in
                this case, is 4 (the size of a <type>float</type>) * 4 (the number of
                    <type>float</type>s in a <type>vec4</type>) * 3 (the number of
                <type>vec4</type>'s in the position data).</para>
            <note>
                <para>If you're wondering why it is <literal>(void*)48</literal> and not just
                        <literal>48</literal>, that is because of some legacy API cruft. The reason
                    why the function name is glVertexAttrib<quote>Pointer</quote> is because the
                    last parameter is technically a pointer to client memory. Or at least, it could
                    be in the past. So we must explicitly cast the integer value 48 to a pointer
                    type.</para>
            </note>
            <para>After this, we use <function>glDrawArrays</function> to render, then disable the
                arrays with <function>glDisableVertexAttribArray.</function></para>
            <section>
                <title>Drawing in Detail</title>
                <para>In the last tutorial, we skimmed over the details of what exactly
                        <function>glDrawArrays</function> does. Let us take a closer look
                    now.</para>
                <para>The various attribute array functions set up arrays for OpenGL to read from
                    when rendering. In our case here, we have two arrays. Each array has a buffer
                    object and an offset into that buffer where the array begins, but the arrays do
                    not have an explicit size. If we look at everything as C++ pseudo-code, what we
                    have is this:</para>
                <example>
                    <title>Vertex Arrays</title>
                    <programlisting language="cpp"><![CDATA[GLbyte *bufferObject = (void*){0.0f, 0.5f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.5f, -0.366f, ...};
float *positionAttribArray[4] = (float *[4])(&(bufferObject + 0));
float *colorAttribArray[4] = (float *[4])(&(bufferObject + 48));]]></programlisting>
                </example>
                <para>Each element of the <varname>positionAttribArray</varname> contains 4
                    components, the size of our input to the vertex shader (vec4). This is the case
                    because the second parameter of <function>glVertexAttribPointer</function> is 4.
                    Each component is a floating-point number; similarly because the third parameter
                    is <literal>GL_FLOAT</literal>. The array takes its data from
                        <varname>bufferObject</varname> because this was the buffer object that was
                    bound at the time that <function>glVertexAttribPointer</function> was called.
                    And the offset from the beginning of the buffer object is 0 because that is the
                    last parameter of <function>glVertexAttribPointer</function>.</para>
                <para>The same goes for <varname>colorAttribArray</varname>, except for the offset
                    value, which is 48 bytes.</para>
                <para>Using the above pseudo-code representation of the vertex array data,
                        <function>glDrawArrays</function> would be implemented as follows:</para>
                <example>
                    <title>Draw Arrays Implementation</title>
                    <programlisting language="cpp"><![CDATA[void glDrawArrays(GLenum type, GLint start, GLint count)
{
    for(GLint element = start; element < start + count; element++)
    {
        VertexShader(positionAttribArray[element], colorAttribArray[element]);
    }
}]]></programlisting>
                </example>
                <para>This means that the vertex shader will be executed <varname>count</varname>
                    times, and it will be given data beginning with the <varname>start</varname>-th
                    element and continuing for <varname>count</varname> elements. So the first time
                    the vertex shader gets run, it takes the position attribute from
                        <literal>bufferObject[0 + (0 * 4 * sizeof(float))]</literal> and the color
                    attribute from <literal>bufferObject[48 + (0 * 4 * sizeof(float))]</literal>.
                    The second time pulls the position from <literal>bufferObject[0 + (1 * 4 *
                        sizeof(float))]</literal> and color from <literal>bufferObject[48 + (1 * 4 *
                        sizeof(float))]</literal>. And so on.</para>
                <para>The data flow from the buffer object to the vertex shaders looks like this
                    now:</para>

            <para>Our new vertex shader looks like this:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Multi-input Vertex Shader</title>
                <programlisting language="glsl"><![CDATA[#version 330

layout (location = 0) in vec4 position;
layout (location = 1) in vec4 color;

smooth out vec4 theColor;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = position;
    theColor = color;
}]]></programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>There are three new lines here. Let us take them one at a time.</para>
            <para>The declaration of the global <varname>color</varname> defines a new input for the
                vertex shader. So this shader, in addition to taking an input named
                    <varname>position</varname> also takes a second input named
                    <varname>color</varname>. As with the <varname>position</varname> input, this
                tutorial assigns each attribute to an attribute index. <varname>position</varname>
                is assigned the attribute index 0, while <varname>color</varname> is assigned
                1.</para>
            <para>That much only gets the data into the vertex shader. We want to pass this data out
                of the vertex shader. To do this, we must define an <glossterm>output
                    variable</glossterm>. This is done using the <literal>out</literal> keyword. In
                this case, the output variable is called <varname>theColor</varname> and is of type
                    <type>vec4</type>.</para>
            <para>The <literal>smooth</literal> keyword is an <glossterm>interpolation
                    qualifier</glossterm>. We will see what this means in a bit later.</para>
            <para>Of course, this simply defines the output variable. In <function>main</function>,
                we actually write to it, assigning to it the value of <varname>color</varname> that
                was given as a vertex attribute. This being shader code, we could have used some
                other heuristic or arbitrary algorithm to compute the color. But for the purpose of
                this tutorial, it is simply passing the value of an attribute passed to the vertex
                shader.</para>
            <para>Technically, the built-in variable <varname>gl_Position</varname> is defined as
                    <literal>out vec4 gl_Position</literal>. So it is an output variable as well. It
                is a special output because this value is directly used by the system, rather than
                used only by shaders. User-defined outputs, like <varname>theColor</varname> above,
                have no intrinsic meaning to the system. They only have an effect in so far as other
                shader stages use them, as we will see next.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Fragment Program</title>
            <para>The new fragment shader looks like this:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Fragment Shader with Input</title>
                <programlisting language="glsl"><![CDATA[#version 330

smooth in vec4 theColor;

out vec4 outputColor;

void main()
{
    outputColor = theColor;
}]]></programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>This fragment shader defines an input variable. It is no coincidence that this
                input variable is named and typed the same as the output variable from the vertex
                shader. We are trying to feed information from the vertex shader to the fragment
                shader. To do this, OpenGL requires that the output from the previous stage have the
                same name and type as the input to the next stage. It also must use the same
                interpolation qualifier; if the vertex shader used <literal>smooth</literal>, the
                fragment shader must do the same.</para>
            <para>This is a good part of the reason why OpenGL requires vertex and fragment shaders
                to be linked together; if the names, types, or interpolation qualifiers do not
                match, then OpenGL will raise an error when the program is linked.</para>
            <para>So the fragment shader receives the value output from the vertex shader. The
                shader simply takes this value and copies it to the output. Thus, the color of each
                fragment will simply be whatever the vertex shader passed along.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Fragment Interpolation</title>
            <para>Now we come to the elephant in the room, so to speak. There is a basic
                communication problem.</para>
            <para>See, our vertex shader is run only 3 times. This execution produces 3 output
                positions (<varname>gl_Position</varname>) and 3 output colors
                    (<varname>theColor</varname>). The 3 positions are used to construct and
                rasterize a triangle, producing a number of fragments.</para>
            <para>The fragment shader is not run 3 times. It is run once for every fragment produced
                by the rasterizer for this triangle. The number of fragments produced by a triangle
                depends on the viewing resolution and how much area of the screen the triangle
                covers. An equilateral triangle the length of who's sides are 1 has an area of
                ~0.433. The total screen area (on the range [-1, 1] in X and Y) is 4, so our
                triangle covers approximately one-tenth of the screen. The window's natural
                resolution is 500x500 pixels. 500*500 is 250,000 pixels; one-tenth of this is
                25,000. So our fragment shader gets executed about 25,000 times.</para>
            <para>There's a slight disparity here. If the vertex shader is directly communicating
                with the fragment shader, and the vertex shader is outputting only 3 total color
                values, where do the other 24,997 values come from?</para>
            <para>The answer is <glossterm>fragment interpolation</glossterm>.</para>
            <para>By using the interpolation qualifier <literal>smooth</literal> when defining the
                vertex output and fragment input, we are telling OpenGL to do something special with
                this value. Instead of each fragment receiving one value from a single vertex, what
                each fragment gets is a <emphasis>blend</emphasis> between the three output values
                over the surface of the triangle. The closer the fragment is to one vertex, the more
                that vertex's output contributes to the value that the fragment program
                receives.</para>
            <para>Because such interpolation is by far the most common mode for communicating
                between the vertex shader and the fragment shader, if you do not provide an
                interpolation keyword, <literal>smooth</literal> will be used by default. There are
                two other alternatives: <literal>noperspective</literal> and
                <literal>flat</literal>.</para>
            <para>If you were to modify the tutorial and change <literal>smooth</literal> to
                    <literal>noperspective</literal>, you would see no change. That does not mean a
                change did not happen; our example is just too simple for there to actually be a
                change. The difference between <literal>smooth</literal> and
                    <literal>noperspective</literal> is somewhat subtle, and only matters once we
                start using more concrete examples. We will discuss this difference later.</para>
            <para>The <literal>flat</literal> interpolation actually turns interpolation off. It
                essentially says that, rather than interpolating between three values, each fragment
                of the triangle will simply get the first of the three vertex shader output
                variables. The fragment shader gets a flat value across the surface of the triangle,
                hence the term <quote><literal>flat</literal>.</quote></para>
            <para>Each rasterized triangle has its own set of 3 outputs that are interpolated to
                compute the value for the fragments created by that triangle. So if you render 2
                triangles, the interpolated values from one triangle do not directly affect the
                interpolated values from another triangle. Thus, each triangle can be taken
                independently from the rest.</para>
            <para>It is possible, and highly desirable in many cases, to build multiple triangles
                from shared vertices and vertex data. But we will discuss this at a later
                time.</para>

    <title>Dynamic Range</title>
    <para>Thus far, our lighting examples have been fairly prosaic. A single light source
        illuminating a simple object hovering above flat terrain. This tutorial will demonstrate how
        to use multiple lights among a larger piece of terrain in a dynamic lighting environment. We
        will demonstrate how to properly light a scene. This is less about the artistic qualities of
        how a scene should look and more about how to make a scene look a certain way if that is how
        you desire it to look.</para>
    <section>
        <?dbhtml filename="Tut12 Setting the Scene.html" ?>
        <title>Setting the Scene</title>
        <para>The intent for this scene is to be dynamic. The terrain will be large and hilly,
            unlike the flat plain we've seen in previous tutorials. It will use vertex colors where
            appropriate to give it terrain-like qualities. There will also be a variety of objects
            on the terrain, each with its own set of reflective characteristics. This will help show
            off the dynamic nature of the scene.</para>
        <para>The very first step in lighting a scene is to explicitly detail what you want; without
            that, you're probably not going to find your way there. In this case, the scene is
            intended to be outdoors, so there will be a single massive directional light shining
            down. There will also be a number of smaller, weaker lights. All of these lights will
            have animated movement.</para>
        <para>The biggest thing here is that we want the scene to dynamically change lighting
            levels. Specifically, we want a full day/night cycle. The sun will sink, gradually
            losing intensity until it has none. There, it will remain until the dawn of the next
            day, where it will gain strength and rise again. The other lights should be
            much weaker in overall intensity than the sun.</para>
        <para>One thing that this requires is a dynamic ambient lighting range. Remember that the
            ambient light is an attempt to resolve the global illumination problem: that light
            bounces around in a scene and can therefore come from many sources. When the sun is at
            full intensity, the ambient lighting of the scene should be bright as well. This will
            mean that surfaces facing away from the sunlight will still be relatively bright, which
            is the case we see outside. When it is night, the ambient light should be virtually nil.
            Only surfaces directly facing one of the lights should be illuminated.</para>
        <para>The <phrase role="propername">Scene Lighting</phrase> tutorial demonstrates the first
            version of attempting to replicate this scene.</para>

        <para>The camera is rotated and zoomed as in prior tutorials. Where this one differs is that
            the camera's target point can be moved. The <keycap>W</keycap>, <keycap>A</keycap>,
                <keycap>S</keycap>, and <keycap>D</keycap> keys move the cameras forward/backwards
            and left/right, relative to the camera's current orientation. The <keycap>Q</keycap> and
                <keycap>E</keycap> keys raise and lower the camera, again relative to its current
            orientation. Holding <keycap>Shift</keycap> with these keys will move in smaller
            increments. You can toggle viewing of the current target point by pressing
                <keycap>T</keycap>.</para>
        <para>Because the lighting in this tutorial is very time based, there are specialized
            controls for playing with time. There are two sets of timers: one that controls the
            sun's position (as well as attributes associated with this, like the sun's intensity,
            ambient intensity, etc), and another set of timers that control the positions of other
            lights in the scene. Commands that affect timers can affect the sun only, the other
            lights only, or both at the same time.</para>
        <para>To have timer commands affect only the sun, press <keycap>2</keycap>. To have timer
            commands affect only the other lights, press <keycap>3</keycap>. To have timer commands
            affect both, press <keycap>1</keycap>.</para>
        <para>To rewind time by one second (of real-time), press the <keycap>-</keycap> key. To jump
            forward one second, press the <keycap>=</keycap> key. To toggle pausing, press the
                <keycap>p</keycap> key. These commands only affect the currently selected timers.
            Also, pressing the <keycap>SpaceBar</keycap> will print out the current sun-based time,
            in 24-hour notation.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Materials and UBOs</title>
            <para>The source code for this tutorial is much more complicated than prior ones. Due to
                this complexity, it is spread over several files. All of the tutorial projects for
                this tutorial share the <filename>Scene.h/cpp</filename> and
                    <filename>Lights.h/cpp</filename> files. The Scene files set up the objects in
                the scene and render them. This file contains the surface properties of the
                objects.</para>
            <para>A lighting function requires two specific sets of parameters: values that
                represent the light, and values that represent the surface. Surface properties are
                often called <glossterm>material properties</glossterm>. Each object has its own
                material properties, as defined in <filename>Scene.cpp</filename>.</para>
            <para>The scene has 6 objects: the terrain, a tall cylinder in the middle, a
                multicolored cube, a sphere, a spinning tetrahedron, and a mysterious black obelisk.
                Each object has its own material properties defined by the
                    <function>GetMaterials</function> function.</para>
            <para>These properties are all stored in a uniform buffer object. We have seen these
                before for data that is shared among several programs; here, we use it to quickly
                change sets of values. These material properties do not change with time; we set
                them once and do not change them ever again. This is primarily for demonstration
                purposes, but it could have a practical effect.</para>
            <para>Each object's material data is defined as the following struct:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Material Uniform Block</title>
                <programlisting language="glsl">//GLSL
layout(std140) uniform;

uniform Material
{
    vec4 diffuseColor;
    vec4 specularColor;
    float specularShininess;
} Mtl;</programlisting>
                <programlisting language="cpp">//C++
struct MaterialBlock
{
    glm::vec4 diffuseColor;
    glm::vec4 specularColor;
    float specularShininess;
    float padding[3];
};</programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>The <varname>padding</varname> variable in the C++ definition represents the fact
                that the GLSL definition of this uniform block will be padded out to a size of 12
                floats. This is due to the nature of <quote>std140</quote> layout (feel free to read
                the appropriate section in the OpenGL specification to see why). Note the global
                definition of <quote>std140</quote> layout; this sets all uniform blocks to use
                    <quote>std140</quote> layout unless they specifically override it. That way, we
                do not have to write <quote>layout(std140)</quote> for each of the three uniform
                blocks we use in each shader file.</para>
            <para>Also, note the use of <literal>Mtl</literal> at the foot of the uniform block
                definition. This is called the <glossterm>instance name</glossterm> of an interface
                block. When no instance name is specified, then the names in the uniform block are
                global. If an instance name is specified, this name must be used to qualify access
                to the names within that block. This allows us to have the <literal>in vec4
                    diffuseColor</literal> be separate from the material definition's
                    <varname>Mtl.diffuseColor</varname>.</para>
            <para>What we want to do is put 6 material blocks in a single uniform buffer. One might
                naively think that one could simply allocate a buffer object 6 times the
                    <literal>sizeof(MaterialBlock)</literal>, and simply store the data as a C++
                array. Sadly, this will not work due to a UBO limitation.</para>
            <para>When you use <function>glBindBufferRange</function> to bind a UBO, OpenGL requires
                that the offset parameter, the parameter that tells where the beginning of the
                uniform block's data is within the buffer object, be aligned to a specific value.
                That is, the begining of a uniform block within a uniform buffer must be a multiple
                of a specific value. 0 works, of course, but since we have more than one block
                within a uniform buffer, they cannot all start at the buffer's beginning.</para>
            <para>What is this value, you may ask? Welcome to the world of implementation-dependent
                values. This means that it can (and most certainly will) change depending on what
                platform you're running on. This code was tested on two different hardware
                platforms; one has a minimum alignment of 64, the other an alignment of 256.</para>
            <para>To retrieve the implementation-dependent value, we must use a previously-unseen
                function: <function>glGetIntegerv</function>. This is a function that does one
                simple thing: gets integer values from OpenGL. However, the meaning of the value
                retrieved depends on the enumerator passed as the first parameter. Basically, it's a
                way to have state retrieval functions that can easily be extended by adding new
                enumerators rather than new functions.</para>
            <para>The code that builds the material uniform buffer is as follows:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Material UBO Construction</title>
                <programlisting language="cpp">int uniformBufferAlignSize = 0;
glGetIntegerv(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER_OFFSET_ALIGNMENT, &amp;uniformBufferAlignSize);

m_sizeMaterialBlock = sizeof(MaterialBlock);
m_sizeMaterialBlock += uniformBufferAlignSize -
	(m_sizeMaterialBlock % uniformBufferAlignSize);

int sizeMaterialUniformBuffer = m_sizeMaterialBlock * MATERIAL_COUNT;

std::vector&lt;MaterialBlock> materials;
GetMaterials(materials);
assert(materials.size() == MATERIAL_COUNT);

std::vector&lt;GLubyte> mtlBuffer;
mtlBuffer.resize(sizeMaterialUniformBuffer, 0);

GLubyte *bufferPtr = &amp;mtlBuffer[0];

for(size_t mtl = 0; mtl &lt; materials.size(); ++mtl)
	memcpy(bufferPtr + (mtl * m_sizeMaterialBlock), &amp;materials[mtl], sizeof(MaterialBlock));

glGenBuffers(1, &amp;m_materialUniformBuffer);
glBindBuffer(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, m_materialUniformBuffer);
glBufferData(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, sizeMaterialUniformBuffer, bufferPtr, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
glBindBuffer(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, 0);</programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>We use <function>glGetIntegerv</function> to retrieve the alignment requirement.
                Then we compute the size of a material block, plus enough padding to satisfy the
                alignment requirements. From there, it's fairly straightforward. The
                    <varname>mtlBuffer</varname> is just a clever way to allocate a block of memory
                without having to directly use new/delete. And yes, that is perfectly valid and
                legal C++.</para>
            <para>When the scene is rendered, it uses <function>glBindBufferRange</function> to bind
                the proper region within the buffer object for rendering.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Lighting</title>
            <para>The code for lighting is rather more complicated. It uses two aspects of the
                framework library to do its job: interpolators and timers.
                    <classname>Framework::Timer</classname> is a generally useful class that can
                keep track of a looped range of time, converting it into a [0, 1) range. The
                interpolators are used to convert a [0, 1) range to a particular value based on a
                series of possible values. Exactly how they work is beyond the scope of this
                discussion, but some basic information will be presented.</para>
            <para>The <classname>LightManager</classname> class controls all timers. It has all of
                the fast-forwarding, rewinding, and so forth controls built into it. It's basic
                functionality is to compute all of the lighting values for a particular time. It
                does this based on information given to it by the main tutorial source file,
                    <filename>Scene Lighting.cpp</filename>. The important values are sent in the
                    <function>SetupDaytimeLighting</function> function.</para>
            <example>
                <title>Daytime Lighting</title>
                <programlisting language="cpp">SunlightValue values[] =
{
    { 0.0f/24.0f, /*...*/},
    { 4.5f/24.0f, /*...*/},
    { 6.5f/24.0f, /*...*/},
    { 8.0f/24.0f, /*...*/},
    {18.0f/24.0f, /*...*/},
    {19.5f/24.0f, /*...*/},
    {20.5f/24.0f, /*...*/},
};

g_lights.SetSunlightValues(values, 7);

g_lights.SetPointLightIntensity(0, glm::vec4(0.2f, 0.2f, 0.2f, 1.0f));
g_lights.SetPointLightIntensity(1, glm::vec4(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.3f, 1.0f));
g_lights.SetPointLightIntensity(2, glm::vec4(0.3f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f));</programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>For the sake of clarity, the actual lighting parameters were removed from the main
                table. The <classname>SunlightValue</classname> struct defines the parameters that
                vary based on the sun's position. Namely, the ambient intensity, the sun's light
                intensity, and the background color. The first parameter of the struct is the time,
                on the [0, 1) range, when the parameters should have this value. A time of 0
                represents noon, and a time of 0.5 represents midnight. For clarity's sake, I used
                24-hour notation (where 0 is noon rather than midnight).</para>
            <para>We will discuss the actual lighting values later.</para>
            <para>The main purpose of the <classname>LightManager</classname> is to retrieve the
                light parameters. This is done by the function
                    <function>GetLightInformation</function>, which takes a matrix (to transform the
                light positions and directions into camera space) and returns a
                    <classname>LightBlock</classname> object. This is an object that represents a
                uniform block defined by the shaders:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Light Uniform Block</title>
                <programlisting language="glsl">struct PerLight
{
    vec4 cameraSpaceLightPos;
    vec4 lightIntensity;
};

const int numberOfLights = 4;

uniform Light
{
    vec4 ambientIntensity;
    float lightAttenuation;
    PerLight lights[numberOfLights];
} Lgt;</programlisting>
                <programlisting language="cpp">struct PerLight
{
    glm::vec4 cameraSpaceLightPos;
    glm::vec4 lightIntensity;
};

const int NUMBER_OF_LIGHTS = 4;

struct LightBlock
{
    glm::vec4 ambientIntensity;
    float lightAttenuation;
    float padding[3];
    PerLight lights[NUMBER_OF_LIGHTS];
};</programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>Again, there is the need for a bit of padding in the C++ version of the struct.
                Also, you might notice that we have both arrays and structs in GLSL for the first
                time. They work pretty much like C/C++ structs and arrays (outside of pointer logic,
                since GLSL does not have pointers), though arrays have certain caveats.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Many Lights Shader</title>
            <para>In this tutorial, we use 4 shaders. Two of these take their diffuse color from
                values passed by the vertex shader. The other two use the material's diffuse color.
                The other difference is that two do specular reflection computations, and the others
                do not. This represents the variety of our materials.</para>
            <para>Overall, the code is nothing you have not seen before. We use Gaussian specular and
                an inverse-squared attenuation, in order to be as physically correct as we currently
                can be. One of the big differences is in the <function>main</function>
                function.</para>
            <example>
                <title>Many Lights Main Function</title>
                <programlisting language="glsl">void main()
{
    vec4 accumLighting = diffuseColor * Lgt.ambientIntensity;
    for(int light = 0; light &lt; numberOfLights; light++)
    {
        accumLighting += ComputeLighting(Lgt.lights[light]);
    }
    
    outputColor = accumLighting;
}</programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>Here, we compute the lighting due to the ambient correction. Then we loop over
                each light and compute the lighting for it, adding it into our accumulated value.
                Loops and arrays are generally fine.</para>
            <para>The other trick is how we deal with positional and directional lights. The
                    <classname>PerLight</classname> structure does not explicitly say whether a light
                is positional or directional. However, the W component of the
                    <varname>cameraSpaceLightPos</varname> is what we use to differentiate them;
                this is a time-honored technique. If the W component is 0.0, then it is a
                directional light; otherwise, it is a point light.</para>
            <para>The only difference between directional and point lights in the lighting function
                are attenuation (directional lights do not use attenuation) and how the light
                direction is computed. So we simply compute these based on the W component:</para>
            <programlisting language="glsl">vec3 lightDir;
vec4 lightIntensity;
if(lightData.cameraSpaceLightPos.w == 0.0)
{
    lightDir = vec3(lightData.cameraSpaceLightPos);
    lightIntensity = lightData.lightIntensity;
}
else
{
    float atten = CalcAttenuation(cameraSpacePosition,
        lightData.cameraSpaceLightPos.xyz, lightDir);
    lightIntensity = atten * lightData.lightIntensity;
}</programlisting>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Lighting Problems</title>
            <para>There are a few problems with our current lighting setup. It looks (mostly) fine
                in daylight. The moving point lights have a small visual effect, but mostly they're
                not very visible. And this is what one would expect in broad daylight; flashlights
                do not make much impact in the day.</para>
            <para>But at night, everything is exceedingly dark. The point lights, the only active
                source of illumination, are all too dim to be very visible. The terrain almost
                completely blends into the black background.</para>
            <para>There is an alternative set of light parameters that corrects this problem. Press <keycombo>
                    <keycap>Shift</keycap>
                    <keycap>L</keycap>
                </keycombo>; that switches to a night-time optimized version (press
                    <keycap>L</keycap> to switch back to day-optimized lighting). Here, the point
                lights provide reasonable lighting at night. The ground is still dark when facing
                away from the lights, but we can reasonably see things.</para>

            <para>The problem is that, in daylight, the night-optimized point lights are too
                powerful. They are very visible and have very strong effects on the scene. Also,
                they cause some light problems when one of the point lights is in the right
                position. At around 12:50, find the floating white light near the cube:</para>

            <para>Notice the patch of iridescent green. This is <glossterm>light
                    clipping</glossterm> or light clamping, and it is usually a very undesirable
                outcome. It happens when the computed light intensity falls outside of the [0, 1]
                range, usually in the positive direction (like in this case). The object cannot be
                shown to be brighter, so it becomes a solid color that loses all detail.</para>
            <para>The obvious solution to our lighting problem is to simply change the point light
                intensity based on the time of day. However, this is not realistic; flashlights
                do not actually get brighter at night. So if we have to do something that
                antithetical to reality, then there's probably some aspect of reality that we are not
                properly modelling.</para>

        <title>High Dynamic Range</title>
        <para>In order to answer this question, we must first determine why flashlights appear
            brighter at night than in the daytime. Much of the answer has to do with our
            eyes.</para>
        <para>The pupil is the hole in our eyes that allows light to pass through it; cameras call
            this hole the aperture. The hole is small, relative to the world, which helps with
            resolving an image. However, the quantity of light that passes through the hole depends
            on how large it is. Our iris's can expand and contract to control the size of the pupil.
            When the pupil is large, more light is allowed to enter the eye; when the pupil is
            small, less light can enter.</para>
        <para>The iris contracts automatically in the presence of bright light, since too much like
            can damage the retina (the surface of the eye that detects light). However, in the
            absence of light, the iris slowly relaxes, expanding the pupil. This has the effect of
            allowing more light to enter the eye, which adds to the apparent brightness of the
            scene.</para>
        <para>So what we need is not to change the overall light levels, but instead apply the
            equivalent of an iris to the final lighting computations of a scene. That is, we
            determine the overall illumination at a point, but we then filter out some of this light
            based on a global setting. In dark scenes, we filter less light, and in bright scenes,
            we filter more light.</para>
        <para>This overall process is called <glossterm>high dynamic range lighting</glossterm>
                (<acronym>HDR</acronym>). It is fairly simple and requires very few additional math
            computations compared to our current model.</para>
        <note>
            <para>You may have heard this term in conjunction with pictures where bright objects
                seem to glow. While HDR is typically associated with that glowing effect, that is a
                different effect called bloom. It is a woefully over-used effect, and we will
                discuss how to implement it later. HDR and bloom do interact, but you can use one
                without the other.</para>
        </note>
        <para>The first step is to end the myth that lights themselves have a global maximum
            brightness. In all previous examples, our light intensity values lived with the range
            [0, 1]. Clamping light intensity to this range simply does not mirror reality. In
            reality, the sun is many orders of magnitude brighter than a flashlight. We must allow
            for this in our lighting equation.</para>
        <para>This also means that our accumulated lighting intensity, the value we originally wrote
            to the fragment shader output, is no longer on the [0, 1] range. And that poses a
            problem. We can perform lighting computations with a high dynamic range, but monitors
            can only display colors on the [0, 1] range. We therefore must map from the HDR to the
            low dynamic range (<acronym>LDR</acronym>).</para>
        <para>This part of HDR rendering is called <glossterm>tone mapping.</glossterm> There are
            many possible tone mapping functions, but we will use one that simulates a flexible
            aperture. It's quite a simple function, really. First, we pick a maximum intensity value
            for the scene; intensity values above this will be clamped. Then, we just divide the HDR
            value by the maximum intensity to get the LDR value.</para>
        <para>It is the maximum intensity that we will vary. As the sun goes down, the intensity
            will go down with it. This will allow the sun to be much brighter in the day than the
            lights, thus overwhelming their contributions to the scene's illumination. But at night,
            when the maximum intensity is much lower, the other lights will have an apparently
            higher brightness.</para>
        <para>This is implemented in the <phrase role="propername">HDR Lighting</phrase>
            tutorial.</para>
        <para>This tutorial controls as the previous one, except that the <keycap>K</keycap> key
            will activate HDR lighting. Pressing <keycap>L</keycap> or <keycombo>
                <keycap>Shift</keycap>
                <keycap>L</keycap>
            </keycombo> will go back to day or night-time LDR lighting from the last tutorial,
            respectively.</para>

        <para>The code is quite straightforward. We add a floating-point field to the
                <classname>Light</classname> uniform block and the <classname>LightBlock</classname>
            struct in C++. Technically, we just steal one of the padding floats, so the size remains
            the same:</para>
        <example>
            <title>HDR LightBlock</title>
            <programlisting language="cpp">struct LightBlockHDR
{
    glm::vec4 ambientIntensity;
    float lightAttenuation;
    float maxIntensity;
    float padding[2];
    PerLight lights[NUMBER_OF_LIGHTS];
};</programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>We also add a new field to <classname>SunlightValue</classname>: the maximum light
            intensity. There is also a new function in the <classname>LightManager</classname> that
            computes the HDR-version of the light block:
            <function>GetLightInformationHDR</function>. Technically, all of this code was already
            in <filename>Light.h/cpp</filename>, since these files are shared among all of the
            tutorials here.</para>
        <section>

            <para>Lighting a scene in HDR is a different process from LDR. Having a varying maximum
                intensity value, as well as the ability to use light intensities greater than 1.0
                change much about how you set up a scene.</para>
            <para>In this case, everything in the lighting was designed to match up to the daytime
                version of LDR in the day, and the nighttime version of LDR at night. Once the
                division by the maximum intensity was taken into account.</para>

            <para>The numbers in parenthesis represents the max intensity at that time.</para>
            <para>In order to keep the daytime lighting the same, we simply multiplied the LDR day's
                sun and ambient intensities by the ratio between the sun intensity and the intensity
                of one of the lights. This ratio is 3:1, so the sun and ambient intensity is
                increased by a magnitude of 3.</para>
            <para>The maximum intensity was derived similarly. In the LDR case, the difference
                between the max intensity (1.0) and the sum of the sun and ambient intensities is
                0.2 (1.0 - (0.6 + 0.2)). To maintain this, we set the max intensity to the sum of
                the ambient and sun intensities, plus 3 times the original ratio.</para>
            <para>This effectively means that the light, as far as the sun and ambient are
                concerned, works the same way in HDR daytime as in the LDR day-optimized settings.
                To get the other lights to work at night, we simply kept their values the same as
                the LDR night-optimized case.</para>

        <title>Linearity and Gamma</title>
        <para>There is one major issue left, and it is one that has been glossed over since the
            beginning of our look at lighting: your screen.</para>
        <para>The fundamental assumption underlying all of our lighting equations since the very
            beginning is the idea that the surface colors and light intensities are all in a linear
                <glossterm>colorspace</glossterm>. A colorspace defines how we translate from a set
            of numerical values to actual, real colors that you can see. A colorspace is a
                <glossterm>linear colorspace</glossterm> if doubling any value in that colorspace
            results in a color that is twice as bright. The linearity refers to the relationship
            between values and overall brightness of the resulting color.</para>
        <para>This assumption can be taken as a given for our data thus far. All of our diffuse and
            specular color values were given by us, so we can know that they represent values in a
            linear RGB colorspace. The light intensities are likewise in a linear colorspace. When
            we multiplied the sun and ambient intensities by 3 in the last section, we were
            increasing the brightness by 3x. Multiplying the maximum intensity by 3 had the effect
            of reducing the overall brightness by 3x.</para>
        <para>There's just one problem: your screen does not work that way. Time for a short history
            of television/monitors.</para>
        <para>The original televisions used an electron gun fired at a phosphor surface to generate
            light and images; this is called a <acronym>CRT</acronym> display (cathode ray tube).
            The strength of the electron beam determined the brightness of that part of the image.
            However, the strength of the beam did not vary linearly with the brightness of the
            image.</para>
        <para>The easiest way to deal with that in the earliest days of TV was to simply modify the
            incoming image at the source. TV broadcasts sent image data that was non-linear in the
            opposite direction of the CRT's normal non-linearity. Thus, the final output was
            displayed linearly, as it was originally captured by the camera.</para>
        <para>The term for this process, de-linearizing an image to compensate for a non-linear
            display, is called <glossterm>gamma correction</glossterm>.</para>
        <para>You may be wondering why this matters. After all, odds are, you do not have a CRT-based
            monitor; you probably have some form of LCD, plasma, LED, or similar technology. So what
            does the vagaries of CRT monitors matter to you?</para>
        <para>Because gamma correction is everywhere. It's in DVDs, video-tapes, and Blu-Ray discs.
            Every digital camera does it. And this is how it has been for a long time. Because of
            that, you could not sell an LCD monitor that tried to do linear color reproduction;
            nobody would buy it because all media for it (including your OS) was designed and
            written expecting CRT-style non-linear displays.</para>
        <para>This means that every non-CRT display must mimic the CRT's non-linearity; this is
            built into the basic video processing logic of every display device.</para>
        <para>So for twelve tutorials now, we have been outputting linear RGB values to a display
            device that expects gamma-corrected non-linear RGB values. But before we started doing
            lighting, we were just picking nice-looking colors, so it did not matter. Now that we're
            doing something vaguely realistic, we need to perform gamma-correction. This will let us
            see what we've <emphasis>actually</emphasis> been rendering, instead of what our
            monitor's gamma-correction circuitry has been mangling.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Gamma Functions</title>
            <para>A gamma function is the function that maps linear RGB space to non-linear RGB
                space. The gamma function for CRT displays was fairly standard, and all non-CRT
                displays mimic this standard. It is ultimately based on a math function of CRT
                displays. The strength of the electron beam is controlled by the voltage passed
                through it. This correlates with the light intensity as follows:</para>
            <equation>
                <title>Display Gamma Function</title>
                <mediaobject>
                    <imageobject>
                        <imagedata fileref="GammaFunc.svg"/>
                    </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
            </equation>
            <para>This is called a gamma function due to the Greek letter γ (gamma). The input
                signal directly controls the voltage, so the input signal needed to be corrected for
                the power of gamma.</para>
            <para>Modern displays usually have gamma adjustments that allow the user to set the
                display's gamma. The default is usually a gamma of around 2.2; this is a useful
                compromise value and an excellent default for our gamma-correction code.</para>
            <para>So, given the gamma function above, we need to output values from our shader that
                will result in our original linear values after the gamma function is applied. This
                is gamma correction, and the function for that is straightforward.</para>
            <equation>
                <title>Gamma Correction Function</title>

                    </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
            </equation>
            <para>It would be interesting to see a graph of these functions, to speculate about what
                we will see in our gamma-correct images.</para>
            <figure>
                <title>Gamma Function Graph</title>

                    </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
            </figure>
            <para>Without gamma correction, our linearRGB colors (the diagonal line in the graph)
                would become the CRT gamma curve at the bottom. This means that what we have been
                seeing is a <emphasis>severely</emphasis> darkened version of our colors. A
                linearRGB value of 0.5 drops to an intensity of 0.218; that's more than half of the
                brightness gone.</para>
            <para>With proper gamma correction, we can expect to see our scene become much
                brighter.</para>

            </figure>
            <para>That is very bright; it uses the same HDR-based lighting environment from the
                previous tutorials. Let's look at some code.</para>
            <para>The gamma value is an odd kind of value. Conceptually, it has nothing to do with
                lighting, per-se. It is a global value across many shaders, so it should be in a UBO
                somewhere. But it is not a material parameter; it does not change from object to
                object. In this tutorial, we stick it in the <classname>Light</classname> uniform
                block and the <classname>LightBlockGamma</classname> struct. Again, we steal a float
                from the padding:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Gamma LightBlock</title>
                <programlisting language="cpp">struct LightBlockGamma
{
    glm::vec4 ambientIntensity;
    float lightAttenuation;
    float maxIntensity;
    float gamma;
    float padding;
    PerLight lights[NUMBER_OF_LIGHTS];
};</programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>For the sake of clarity in this tutorial, we send the actual gamma value. For
                performance's sake, we ought send 1/gamma, so that we do not have to needlessly do a
                division in every fragment.</para>
            <para>The gamma is applied in the fragment shader as follows:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Fragment Gamma Correction</title>
                <programlisting language="glsl">accumLighting = accumLighting / Lgt.maxIntensity;
vec4 gamma = vec4(1.0 / Lgt.gamma);
gamma.w = 1.0;
outputColor = pow(accumLighting, gamma);</programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>Otherwise, the code is mostly unchanged from the HDR tutorial. Speaking of which,
                gamma correction does not require HDR per se, nor does HDR require gamma correction.
                However, the combination of the two has the power to create substantial improvements
                in overall visual quality.</para>
            <para>One final change in the code is for light values that are written directly,
                without any lighting computations. The background color is simply the clear color
                for the framebuffer. Even so, it needs gamma correction too; this is done on the CPU
                by gamma correcting the color before drawing it. If you have any other colors that
                are drawn directly, <emphasis>do not</emphasis> forget to do this.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Gamma Correct Lighting</title>
            <para>What we have seen is what happens when you apply HDR lighting to a scene who's
                light properties were defined <emphasis>without</emphasis> gamma correction. Look at
                the scene at night; the point lights are extremely bright, and their lighting
                effects seem to go much farther than before. This last point bears
                investigating.</para>
            <para>When we first talked about light attenuation, we said that the correct attenuation
                function for a point light was an inverse-square relationship with respect to the
                distance to the light. We also said that this usually looked wrong, so people often
                used a plain inverse attenuation function.</para>
            <para>Gamma is the reason for this. Or rather, lack of gamma correction is the reason.
                Without correcting for the display's gamma function, the attenuation of <inlineequation>
                    <mathphrase>1/r<superscript>2</superscript></mathphrase>
                </inlineequation> effectively becomes <inlineequation>
                    <mathphrase>(1/r<superscript>2</superscript>)<superscript>2.2</superscript></mathphrase>
                </inlineequation>, which is <inlineequation>
                    <mathphrase>1/r<superscript>4.4</superscript></mathphrase>
                </inlineequation>. The lack of proper gamma correction magnifies the effective
                attenuation of lights. A simple <inlineequation>
                    <mathphrase>1/r</mathphrase>
                </inlineequation> relationship looks better without gamma correction because the
                display's gamma function turns it into something that is much closer to being in a
                linear colorspace: <inlineequation>
                    <mathphrase>1/r<superscript>2.2</superscript></mathphrase>
                </inlineequation>.</para>
            <para>Since this lighting environment was not designed while looking at gamma correct
                results, let's look at some scene lighting that was developed with proper gamma in
                mind. Turn on gamma correction and set the gamma value to 2.2 (the default if you
                did not change it). The press <keycombo>
                    <keycap>Shift</keycap>
                    <keycap>L</keycap>
                </keycombo>:</para>
            <figure>
                <title>Gamma Lighting</title>
                <mediaobject>
                    <imageobject>

                    </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
            </figure>
            <para>This is more like it.</para>
            <para>If there is one point you should learn from this exercise, it is this: make sure
                that you implement gamma correction and HDR <emphasis>before</emphasis> trying to
                light your scenes. If you do not, then you may have to adjust all of the lighting
                parameters again, and you may need to change materials as well. In this case, it
                was not even possible to use simple corrective math on the lighting environment to
                make it work right. This lighting environment was developed essentially from
                scratch.</para>
            <para>One thing we can notice when looking at the gamma correct lighting is that proper
                gamma correction improves shadow details substantially:</para>
            <figure>
                <title>Gamma Shadow Details</title>
                <mediaobject>
                    <imageobject>
                        <imagedata fileref="Gamma%20Compare.png"/>
                    </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
            </figure>
            <para>These two images use the HDR lighting; the one on the left does not have gamma
                correction, and the one on the right does. Notice how easy it is to make out the
                details in the hills near the triangle on the right.</para>
            <para>Looking at the gamma function, this makes sense. Without proper gamma correction,
                fully half of the linearRGB range is shoved into the bottom one-fifth of the
                available light intensity. That does not leave much room for areas that are dark but
                not too dark to see anything.</para>
            <para>As such, gamma correction is a key process for producing color-accurate rendered
                images. It allows details within darkness to show up much more easily.</para>

            <para>HDR is a pretty large field. This tutorial covered perhaps the simplest form of
                tone mapping, but there are many equations one can use. There are tone mapping
                functions that map the full [0, ∞) range to [0, 1]. This would not be useful for a
                scene that needs a dynamic aperture size, but if the aperture is static, it does
                allow the use of a large range of lighting values.</para>
            <para>When doing tone mapping with some form of variable aperture setting, computing the
                proper maximum intensity value can be difficult. Having a hard-coded value, even one
                that varies algorithmically, works well enough for some scenes. But for scenes where
                the user can control where the camera faces, it can be inappropriate. In many modern
                games, they actually read portions of the rendered image back to the CPU and do some
                computational analysis to determine what the maximum intensity should be for the
                next frame. This is delayed, of course, but it allows for an aperture that varies
                based on what the player is currently looking at, rather than hard-coded
                values.</para>
            <para>Just remember: pick your HDR and tone mapping algorithms
                    <emphasis>before</emphasis> you start putting the scene together. If you try to
                change them mid-stream, you will have to redo a lot of work.</para>

                <glossdef>
                    <para>The set of inputs to the lighting equation that represent the
                        characteristics of a surface. This includes the surface's normal, diffuse
                        reflectance, specular reflectance, any specular power values, and so forth.
                        The source of these values can come from many sources: uniform values for an
                        object, fragment-shader inputs, or potentially other sources.</para>

                <glossdef>
                    <para>For uniform blocks (or other kinds of interface blocks), this name is used
                        within a shader to name-qualifier the members of the block. These are
                        optional, unless there is a naming conflict, or unless an array needs to be
                        specified.</para>

                <glossdef>
                    <para>Light values drawn to the screen are clamped to the range [0, 1]. When
                        lighting produces values outside of this range, the light is said to be
                        clipped by the range. This produces a very bright, flat section that loses
                        all detail and distinction in the image. It is something best
                        avoided.</para>

                <glossdef>
                    <para>Lighting that uses values outside of the [0, 1] range. This allows for the
                        use of a full range of lighting intensities.</para>

                <glossdef>
                    <para>The process of mapping HDR values to a [0, 1] range. This may or may not
                        be a linear mapping.</para>

                <glossdef>
                    <para>The set of reference colors that define a way of representing a color in
                        computer graphics, and the function mapping between those reference colors
                        and the actual colors. All colors are defined relative to a particular
                        colorspace.</para>

                <glossdef>
                    <para>A colorspace where the brightness of a color varies linearly with its
                        values. Doubling the value of a color doubles its brightness.</para>

                <glossdef>
                    <para>The process of converting from a linear colorspace to a non-linear
                        colorspace that a display device expects, usually through the use of a power
                        function. This process ensures that the display produces an image that is
                        linear.</para>

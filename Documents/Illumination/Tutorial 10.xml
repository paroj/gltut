    <title>Plane Lights</title>
    <para>Directional lights are useful for representing light sources like the sun and so forth.
        But most light sources are more likely to be represented as point lights.</para>
    <para>A <glossterm>point light source</glossterm> is a light source that has a position in the
        world and shines with equal intensity in all directions. Our simple diffuse lighting
        equation is a function of these properties:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>The surface normal at that point.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>The direction from the point on the surface to the light.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The direction to the light source from the point is a constant when dealing with
        directional light. It is a parameter for lighting, but it is a constant value for all points
        in the scene. The difference between directional lighting and point lights is only that this
        direction must be computed for each position in the scene.</para>
    <para>Computing this is quite simple. At the point of interest, we take the difference between
        the point on the surface and the light's position. We normalize the result to produce a unit
        vector direction to the light. Then we use the light direction as we did before. The surface
        point, light position, and surface normal must all be in the same space for this equation to
        make sense.</para>

        <title>Vertex Point Lighting</title>
        <para>Thus far, we have computed the lighting equation at each vertex and interpolated the
            results across the surface of the triangle. We will continue to do so for point lights.
            For the moment, at least.</para>
        <para>We implement point lights per-vertex in the <phrase role="propername">Vertex Point
                Lighting</phrase> tutorial. This tutorial has a moving point light that circles
            around the cylinder.</para>

        <para>To toggle an indicator of the light's position, press the <keycap>Y</keycap> key. The
                <keycap>B</keycap> key will toggle rotation of the light. The <keycap>I</keycap> and
                <keycap>K</keycap> keys move the light up and down respectively, while the
                <keycap>J</keycap> and <keycap>L</keycap> keys will decrease and increase the
            light's radius. Holding shift with these keys will move in smaller increments.</para>
        <para>Most of the code is nothing we have not seen elsewhere. The main changes are at the top
            of the rendering function.</para>
        <example>
            <title>Per-Vertex Point Light Rendering</title>
            <programlisting language="cpp">glutil::MatrixStack modelMatrix;
modelMatrix.SetMatrix(g_viewPole.CalcMatrix());

const glm::vec4 &amp;worldLightPos = CalcLightPosition();

glm::vec4 lightPosCameraSpace = modelMatrix.Top() * worldLightPos;

glUseProgram(g_WhiteDiffuseColor.theProgram);
glUniform3fv(g_WhiteDiffuseColor.lightPosUnif, 1, glm::value_ptr(lightPosCameraSpace));
glUseProgram(g_VertexDiffuseColor.theProgram);
glUniform3fv(g_VertexDiffuseColor.lightPosUnif, 1, glm::value_ptr(lightPosCameraSpace));</programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>The light is computed initially in world space, then transformed into camera space.
            The camera-space light position is given to both of the shaders. Rendering proceeds
            normally from there.</para>
        <para>Our vertex shader, <filename>PosVertexLighting_PCN.vert</filename> has had a few
            changes:</para>
        <example>
            <title>Per-Vertex Point Light Vertex Shader</title>
            <programlisting language="glsl">#version 330

layout(location = 0) in vec3 position;
layout(location = 1) in vec4 diffuseColor;
layout(location = 2) in vec3 normal;

smooth out vec4 interpColor;

uniform vec3 lightPos;
uniform vec4 lightIntensity;
uniform vec4 ambientIntensity;

uniform mat4 modelToCameraMatrix;

    mat4 cameraToClipMatrix;
};

void main()
{
    vec4 cameraPosition = (modelToCameraMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0));
    gl_Position = cameraToClipMatrix * cameraPosition;
    
    vec3 normCamSpace = normalize(normalModelToCameraMatrix * normal);
    
    vec3 dirToLight = normalize(lightPos - vec3(cameraPosition));
    
    float cosAngIncidence = dot(normCamSpace, dirToLight);
    cosAngIncidence = clamp(cosAngIncidence, 0, 1);
    
    interpColor = (diffuseColor * lightIntensity * cosAngIncidence) +
        (diffuseColor * ambientIntensity);
}</programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>The vertex shader takes a camera-space light position instead of a camera-space light
            direction. It also stores the camera-space vertex position in a temporary in the first
            line of <function>main</function>. This is used to compute the direction to the light.
            From there, the computation proceeds normally.</para>
        <para>Note the order of operations in computing <varname>dirToLight.</varname> The
                <varname>lightPos</varname> is on the left and the <varname>cameraPosition</varname>
            is on the right. Geometrically, this is correct. If you have two points, and you want to
            find the direction from point A to point B, you compute B - A. The
                <function>normalize</function> call is just to convert it into a unit vector.</para>

        <title>Interpolation</title>
        <para>As you can see, doing point lighting is quite simple. Unfortunately, the visual
            results are not.</para>
        <para>For example, use the controls to display the position of the point light source, then
            position it near the ground plane. See anything wrong?</para>
        <para>If everything were working correctly, one would expect to see a bright area directly
            under the light. After all, geometrically, this situation looks like this:</para>
        <figure>
            <title>Light Near Surface</title>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="LightNearSurface.svg" />
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </figure>
        <para>The surface normal for the areas directly under the light are almost the same as the
            direction towards the light. This means that the angle of incidence is small, so the
            cosine of this angle is close to 1. That should translate to having a bright area under
            the light, but darker areas farther away. What we see is nothing of the sort. Why is
            that?</para>
        <para>Well, consider what we are doing. We are computing the lighting at every triangle's
                <emphasis>vertex</emphasis>, and then interpolating the results across the surface
            of the triangle. The ground plane is made up of precisely four vertices: the four
            corners. And those are all very far from the light position and have a very large angle
            of incidence. Since none of them have a small angle of incidence, none of the colors
            that are interpolated across the surface are bright.</para>
        <para>You can see this is evident by putting the light position next to the cylinder. If the
            light is at the top or bottom of the cylinder, then the area near the light will be
            bright. But if you move the light to the middle of the cylinder, far the top or bottom
            vertices, then the illumination will be much dimmer.</para>
        <para>This is not the only problem with doing per-vertex lighting. For example, run the
            tutorial again and do not move the light. Just watch how the light behaves on the
            cylinder's surface as it animates around. Unlike with directional lighting, you can very
            easily see the triangles on the cylinder's surface. Though the per-vertex computations
            are not helping matters, the main problem here has to do with interpolating the
            values.</para>
        <para>If you move the light source farther away, you can see that the triangles smooth out
            and become indistinct from one another. But this is simply because, if the light source
            is far enough away, the results are indistinguishable from a directional light. Each
            vertex's direction to the light is almost the same as each other vertex's direction to
            the light.</para>
        <para>Per-vertex lighting was reasonable when dealing with directional lights. But it simply
            is not a good idea for point lighting. The question arises: why was per-vertex lighting
            good with directional lights to begin with?</para>
        <para>Remember that our diffuse lighting equation has two parameters: the direction to the
            light and the surface normal. In directional lighting, the direction to the light is
            always the same. Therefore, the only value that changes over a triangle's surface is the
            surface normal.</para>
        <para>Linear interpolation of vectors looks like this:</para>
        <informalequation>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata  fileref="StandardLerp_1.svg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalequation>
        <para>The α in the equation is the factor of interpolation between the two values. When α is
            one, we get V<subscript>a</subscript>, and when it is zero, we get
                V<subscript>b</subscript>. The two values, V<subscript>a</subscript> and
                V<subscript>b</subscript> can be scalars or vectors.</para>
        <para>Our diffuse lighting equation is this:</para>
        <informalequation>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata  fileref="DiffuseLightEq_2.svg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalequation>
        <para>If the surface normal N is being interpolated, then at any particular point on the
            surface, we get this equation for a directional light (the light direction L does not
            change):</para>
        <informalequation>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata  fileref="LerpDiffuse_3.svg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalequation>
        <para>The dot product is distributive, like scalar multiplication. So we can distribute the
            L to both sides of the dot product term:</para>
        <informalequation>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata  fileref="LerpDiffuse_4.svg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalequation>
        <para>We can extract the linear terms from the dot product. Remember that the dot product is
            the cosine of the angle between two vectors, times the length of those vectors. The two
            scaling terms directly modify the length of the vectors. So they can be pulled out to
            give us:</para>
        <informalequation>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata  fileref="LerpDiffuse_5.svg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalequation>
        <para>Recall that vector/scalar multiplication is distributive. We can distribute the
            multiplication by the diffuse color and light intensity to both terms. This gives
            us:</para>
        <informalequation>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata  fileref="LerpDiffuse_6.svg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalequation>
        <para>This means that if L is constant, linearly interpolating N is exactly equivalent to
            linearly interpolating the results of the lighting equation. And the addition of the
            ambient term does not change this, since it is a constant and would not be affected by
            linear interpolation.</para>
        <para>When doing point lighting, you would have to interpolate both N and L. And that does
            not yield the same results as linearly interpolating the two colors you get from the
            lighting equation. This is a big part of the reason why the cylinder does not look
            correct.</para>
        <para>The more physically correct method of lighting is to perform lighting at every rendered
            pixel. To do that, we would have to interpolate the lighting parameters across the
            triangle, and perform the lighting computation in the fragment shader.</para>

    <section>
        <?dbhtml filename="Tut10 Fragment Lighting.html" ?>
        <title>Fragment Lighting</title>
        <para>So, in order to deal with interpolation artifacts, we need to interpolate the actual
            light direction and normal, instead of just the results of the lighting equation. This
            is called per-fragment lighting or just <glossterm>fragment lighting.</glossterm></para>
        <para>This is pretty simple, conceptually. We simply need to do the lighting computations in
            the fragment shader. So the fragment shader needs the position of the fragment, the
            light's position (or the direction to the light from that position), and the surface
            normal of the fragment at that position. And all of these values need to be in the same
            coordinate space.</para>
        <para>There is a problem that needs to be dealt with first. Normals do not interpolate well.
            Or rather, wildly different normals do not interpolate well. And light directions can be
            very different if the light source is close to the triangle relative to that triangle's
            size.</para>
        <para>Consider the large plane we have. The direction toward the light will be very
            different at each vertex, so long as our light remains in relatively close proximity to
            the plane.</para>
        <para>Part of the problem is with interpolating values along the diagonal of our triangle.
            Interpolation within a triangle works like this. For any position within the area of the
            triangle, that position can be expressed as a weighted sum of the positions of the three
            vertices.</para>
        <figure>
            <title>Triangle Interpolation</title>

        </informalequation>
        <para>The α, β, and γ values are not the distances from their respective points to the point
            of interest. In the above case, the point P is in the exact center of the triangle.
            Thus, the three values are each ⅓.</para>
        <para>If the point of interest is along an edge of the triangle, then the contribution of
            the vertex not sharing that edge is zero.</para>
        <figure>
            <title>Triangle Edge Interpolation</title>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="BarycentricTriangleEdge.svg" />
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </figure>
        <para>Here, point P is exactly halfway between points C and B. Therefore,  β, and γ are both
            0.5, but α is 0.0. If point P is anywhere along the edge of a triangle, it gets none of
            its final interpolated value from the third vertex. So along a triangle's edge, it acts
            like the kind of linear interpolation we have seen before.</para>
        <para>This is how OpenGL interpolates the vertex shader outputs. It takes the α, β, and γ
            coordinates for the fragment's position and combines them with the vertex output value
            for the three vertices in the same way it does for the fragment's position. There is
            slightly more to it than that, but we will discuss that later.</para>
        <para>The ground plane in our example is made of two large triangles. They look like
            this:</para>
        <figure>
            <title>Two Triangle Quadrilateral</title>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="TwoTriangleQuad.svg" />
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </figure>
        <para>What happens if we put the color black on the top-right and bottom-left points, and
            put the color green on the top-left and bottom-right points? If you interpolate these
            across the surface, you would get this:</para>
        <figure>
            <title>Two Triangle Interpolation</title>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="TwoTriangleInterpolation.svg" />
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </figure>
        <para>The color is pure green along the diagonal. That is because along a triangle's edge,
            the value interpolated will only be the color of the two vertices along that edge. The
            value is interpolated based only on each triangle individually, not on extra data from
            another neighboring triangle.</para>
        <para>In our case, this means that for points along the main diagonal, the light direction
            will only be composed of the direction values from the two vertices on that diagonal.
            This is not good. This would not be much of a problem if the light direction did not
            change much along the surface, but with large triangles (relative to how close the light
            is to them), that is simply not the case.</para>
        <para>Since we cannot interpolate the light direction very well, we need to interpolate
            something else. Something that does exhibit the characteristics we need when
            interpolated.</para>
        <para>Positions interpolate quite well. Interpolating the top-left position and bottom-right
            positions gets an accurate position value along the diagonal. So instead of
            interpolating the light direction, we interpolate the components of the light direction.
            Namely, the two positions. The light position is a constant, so we only need to
            interpolate the vertex position.</para>
        <para>Now, we could do this in any space. But for illustrative purposes, we will be doing
            this in model space. That is, both the light position and vertex position will be in
            model space.</para>
        <para>One of the advantages of doing things in model space is that it gets rid of that pesky
            matrix inverse/transpose we had to do to transform normals correctly. Indeed, normals
            are not transformed at all. One of the disadvantages is that it requires computing an
            inverse matrix for our light position, so that we can go from world space to model
            space.</para>

            fragment lighting works.</para>

            lighting and per-vertex lighting.</para>
        <para>The rendering code has changed somewhat, considering the use of model space for
            lighting instead of camera space. The start of the rendering looks as follows:</para>

        <para>The new code is the last line, where we transform the world-space light into camera
            space. This is done to make the math much easier. Since our matrix stack is building up
            the transform from model to camera space, the inverse of this matrix would be a
            transform from camera space to model space. So we need to put our light position into
            camera space before we transform it by the inverse.</para>
        <para>After doing that, it uses a variable to switch between per-vertex and per-fragment
            lighting. This just selects which shaders to use; both sets of shaders take the same

        <para>The shaders are where the real action is. As with previous lighting tutorials, there
            are two sets of shaders: one that take a per-vertex color, and one that uses a constant
            white color. The vertex shaders that do per-vertex lighting computations should be
            familiar:</para>

        <para>The math is essentially identical between the per-vertex and per-fragment case. The

                </keycombo> key to move the light really close to the cylinder, but without putting
                the light inside the cylinder. You should see something like this:</para>

                </mediaobject>
            </figure>
            <para>Notice the vertical bands on the cylinder. This are reminiscent of the same
                interpolation problem we had before. Was not doing lighting at the fragment level
                supposed to fix this?</para>
            <para>It is similar to the original problem, but technically different. Per-vertex
                lighting caused lines because of color interpolation artifacts. This is caused by an
                optical illusion created by adjacent linear gradients.</para>
            <para>The normal is being interpolated linearly across the surface. This also means that
                the lighting is changing somewhat linearly across the surface. While the lighting
                isn't a linear change, it can be approximated as one over a small area of the
                surface.</para>
            <para>The edge between two triangles changes how the light interacts. On one side, the
                nearly-linear gradient has one slope, and on the other side, it has a different one.
                That is, the rate at which the gradients change abruptly changes.</para>
            <para>Here is a simple demonstration of this:</para>
            <figure>
                <title>Adjacent Gradient</title>
                <mediaobject>
                    <imageobject>
                        <imagedata fileref="GradientIssue.svg"/>
                    </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
            </figure>
            <para>These are two adjacent linear gradients, from the bottom left corner to the top
                right. The color value increases in intensity as it goes from the bottom left to the
                top right. They meet along the diagonal in the middle. Both gradients have the same
                color value in the middle, yet it appears that there is a line down the center that
                is brighter than the colors on both sides. But it is not; the color on the right
                side of the diagonal is actually brighter than the diagonal itself.</para>
            <para>That is the optical illusion. Here is a diagram that shows the color intensity as
                it moves across the above gradient:</para>
            <figure>
                <title>Gradient Intensity Plot</title>

                    </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
            </figure>
            <para>The color curve is continuous; there are no breaks or sudden jumps. But it is not
                a smooth curve; there is a sharp edge.</para>
            <para>It turns out that human vision really wants to find sharp edges in smooth
                gradients. Anytime we see a sharp edge, our brains try to turn that into some kind
                of shape. And if there is a shape to the gradient intersection, such as a line, we
                tend to see that intersection <quote>pop</quote> out at us.</para>
            <para>The solution to this problem is not yet available to us. One of the reasons we can
                see this so clearly is that the surface has a very regular diffuse reflectance (ie:
                color). If the surface color was irregular, if it changed at most every fragment,
                then the effect would be virtually impossible to notice.</para>
            <para>But the real source of the problem is that the normal is being linearly
                interpolated. While this is certainly much better than interpolating the per-vertex
                lighting output, it does not produce a normal that matches with the normal of a
                perfect cylinder. The correct solution, which we will get to eventually, is to
                provide a way to encode the normal for a surface at many points, rather than simply
                interpolating vertex normals.</para>

        <para>There is another issue with our current example. Use the <keycap>i</keycap> key to
            raise the light up really high. Notice how bright all of the upwardly-facing surfaces
            get:</para>

        </figure>
        <para>You probably have no experience with this in real life. Holding a light farther from
            the surface in reality does not make the light brighter. So obviously something is
            happening in reality that our simple lighting model is not accounting for.</para>
        <para>In reality, lights emit a certain quantity of light per unit time. For a point-like
            light such as a light bulb, it emits this light radially, in all directions. The farther
            from the light source one gets, the more area that this must ultimately cover.</para>
        <para>Light is essentially a wave. The farther away from the source of the wave, the less
            intense the wave is. For light, this is called <glossterm>light
            attenuation.</glossterm></para>
        <para>Our model does not include light attenuation, so let's fix that.</para>
        <para>Attenuation is a well-understood physical phenomenon. In the absence of other factors
            (atmospheric light scattering, etc), the light intensity varies with the inverse of the
            square of the distance. An object 2 units away from the light feels the light with
            one-fourth the intensity. So our equation for light attenuation is as follows:</para>
        <equation>
            <title>Physical Light Attenuation</title>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata  fileref="LightAttenEq.svg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </equation>
        <para>There is a constant in the equation, which is used for unit correction. Of course, we
            can (and will) use it as a fudge factor to make things look right.</para>
        <para>The constant can take on a physical meaning. The constant can mean the distance at
            which half of the light intensity is lost. To compute such a constant, for a half-light
            distance of r<subscript>λ</subscript>, use this equation:</para>
        <informalequation>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata  fileref="HalfLightAtten.svg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalequation>
        <para>This equation computes physically realistic light attenuation for point-lights. But it
            often does not look very good. The equation tends to create a sharper intensity falloff than
            one would expect.</para>
        <para>There is a reason for this, but it is not one we are ready to get into quite yet. What
            is often done is to simply use the inverse rather than the inverse-square of the
            distance:</para>
        <equation>
            <title>Light Attenuation Inverse</title>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata  fileref="LightAttenInvEq.svg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </equation>
        <para>It looks brighter at greater distances than the physically correct model. This is fine
            for simple examples, but as we get more advanced, it will not be acceptable. This
            solution is really just a stop-gap; the real solution is one that we will discuss in a
            few tutorials.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Reverse of the Transform</title>
            <para>However, there is a problem. We previously did per-fragment lighting in model
                space. And while this is a perfectly useful space to do lighting in, model space is
                not world space.</para>
            <para>We want to specify the attenuation constant factor in terms of world space
                distances. But we are not dealing in world space; we are in model space. And model
                space distances are, naturally, in model space, which may well be scaled relative to
                world space. Here, any kind of scale in the model-to-world transform is a problem,
                not just non-uniform scales. Although if there was a uniform scale, we could apply
                theoretically apply the scale to the attenuation constant.</para>
            <para>So now we cannot use model space. Fortunately, camera space is a space that has
                the same scale as world space, just with a rotation/translation applied to it. So we
                can do our lighting in that space.</para>
            <para>Doing it in camera space requires computing a camera space position and passing it
                to the fragment shader to be interpolated. And while we could do this, that's not
                clever enough. Is not there some way to get around that?</para>
            <para>Yes, there is. Recall <varname>gl_FragCoord</varname>, an intrinsic value given to
                every fragment shader. It represents the location of the fragment in window space.
                So instead of transforming from model space to camera space, we will transform from
                window space to camera space.</para>
            <note>
                <para>The use of this reverse-transformation technique here should not be taken as a
                    suggestion to use it in all, or even most cases like this. In all likelihood, it
                    will be much slower than just passing the camera space position to the fragment
                    shader. It is here primarily for demonstration purposes, and because it will be
                    useful in the future.</para>
            </note>

            <para>This tutorial controls as before, with the following exceptions. The
                    <keycap>O</keycap> and <keycap>U</keycap> keys increase and decrease the
                attenuation constant. However, remember that decreasing the constant makes the
                attenuation less, which makes the light appear <emphasis>brighter</emphasis> at a
                particular distance. Using the shift key in combination with them will
                increase/decrease the attenuation by smaller increments. The <keycap>H</keycap> key
                swaps between the linear and quadratic interpolation functions.</para>
            <para>The drawing code is mostly the same as we saw in the per-vertex point light
                tutorial, since both this and that one perform lighting in camera space. The vertex
                shader is also nothing new; passes the vertex normal and color to the fragment
                shader. The vertex normal is multiplied by the normal matrix, which allows us to use
                non-uniform scaling.</para>

        <section>
            <title>New Uniform Types</title>
            <para>The more interesting part is the fragment shader. The definitions are not much
                changed from the last one, but there have been some additions:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Light Attenuation Fragment Shader Definitions</title>
                <programlisting language="glsl">uniform float lightAttenuation;
uniform bool bUseRSquare;

uniform UnProjection
{
    mat4 clipToCameraMatrix;
    ivec2 windowSize;
};</programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>The <varname>lightAttenuation</varname> uniform is just a float, but
                    <varname>bUseRSquare</varname> uses a new type: boolean.</para>
            <para>GLSL has the <type>bool</type> type just like C++ does. The
                    <literal>true</literal> and <literal>false</literal> values work just like C++'s
                equivalents. Where they differ is that GLSL also has vectors of bools, called
                    <type>bvec#</type>, where the # can be 2, 3, or 4. We do not use that here, but
                it is important to note.</para>
            <para>OpenGL's API, however, is still a C API. And C (at least, pre-C99) has no
                    <type>bool</type> type. Uploading a boolean value to a shader looks like
                this:</para>
            <programlisting language="cpp">glUniform1i(g_FragWhiteDiffuseColor.bUseRSquareUnif, g_bUseRSquare ? 1 : 0);</programlisting>
            <para>The integer form of uniform uploading is used, but the floating-point form could
                be allowed as well. The number 0 represents false, and any other number is
                true.</para>
            <para>The <classname>UnProjection</classname> uniform block contains data that only
                changes when the window changes. This uniform block is updated along with the vertex
                shader's <classname>Projection</classname> block. This data is used to perform the
                previously-discussed reverse-transformation operation, so that we can turn
                    <varname>gl_FragCoord</varname> into a camera-space position.</para>
            <para>Notice that the <varname>windowSize</varname> uses a new type: <type>ivec2</type>.
                This is a 2-dimensional vector of integers.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Functions in GLSL</title>
            <para>For the first time, we have a shader complex enough that splitting it into
                different functions makes sense. So we do that. The first function is one that
                computes the camera-space position:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Window to Camera Space Function</title>
                <programlisting language="glsl">vec3 CalcCameraSpacePosition()
{
    vec4 ndcPos;
    ndcPos.xy = ((gl_FragCoord.xy / windowSize.xy) * 2.0) - 1.0;
    ndcPos.z = (2.0 * gl_FragCoord.z - gl_DepthRange.near - gl_DepthRange.far) /
        (gl_DepthRange.far - gl_DepthRange.near);
    ndcPos.w = 1.0;
    
    vec4 clipPos = ndcPos / gl_FragCoord.w;
    
    return vec3(clipToCameraMatrix * clipPos);
}</programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>Not unsurprisingly, GLSL functions are defined much like C and C++
                functions.</para>
            <para>The first three lines compute the position in normalized device coordinates.
                Notice that the computation of the X and Y coordinates is simplified from the
                original function. This is because our viewport always sets the lower-left position
                of the viewport to (0, 0). This is what you get when you plug zeros into that
                equation.</para>
            <para>The <varname>gl_DepthRange</varname> variable is a special uniform defined by GLSL
                for fragment shaders. As the name suggests, it properly mirrors the values passed to
                    <function>glDepthRange</function>; this way, we do not have to put it in our
                uniform block.</para>
            <para>After the transformation to NDC space, we compute the clip-space position as
                previously shown. Then the result is multiplied through the clip-to-camera matrix,
                and that vector is returned to the caller.</para>
            <para>This is a simple function that uses only uniforms to compute a value. It takes no
                arguments. The second function is not quite as simple.</para>
            <example>
                <title>Light Intensity Application Function</title>
                <programlisting language="glsl">vec4 ApplyLightIntensity(in vec3 cameraSpacePosition, out vec3 lightDirection)
{
    vec3 lightDifference =  cameraSpaceLightPos - cameraSpacePosition;
    float lightDistanceSqr = dot(lightDifference, lightDifference);
    lightDirection = lightDifference * inversesqrt(lightDistanceSqr);
    
    float distFactor = bUseRSquare ? lightDistanceSqr : sqrt(lightDistanceSqr);
    
    return lightIntensity * (1 / ( 1.0 + lightAttenuation * distFactor));
}</programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>The function header looks rather different from the standard C/C++ function
                definition syntax. Parameters to GLSL functions are designated as being inputs,
                outputs, or inputs and outputs.</para>
            <para>Parameters designated with <literal>in</literal> are input parameters. Functions
                can change these values, but they will have no effect on the variable or expression
                used in the function call. This is much like the default in C/C++, where parameter
                changes are local. Naturally, this is the default with GLSL parameters if you do not
                specify a qualifier.</para>
            <para>Parameters designated with <literal>out</literal> can be written to, and its value
                will be returned to the calling function. These are similar to non-const reference
                parameter types in C++. And just as with reference parameters, the caller of a
                function must call it with a real variable (called an <quote>l-value</quote>). And
                this variable must be a variable that can be <emphasis>changed</emphasis>, so you
                cannot pass a uniform or shader stage input value as this parameter.</para>
            <para>However, the initial value of parameters declared as outputs is
                    <emphasis>not</emphasis> initialized from the calling function. This means that
                the initial value is uninitialized and therefore undefined (ie: it could be
                anything). Because of this, you can pass shader stage outputs as
                    <literal>out</literal> parameters. Recall that shader stage output variables can
                be written to, but <emphasis>never</emphasis> read from.</para>
            <para>Parameters designated as <literal>inout</literal> will have its value initialized
                by the caller and have the final value returned to the caller. These are exactly
                like non-const reference parameters in C++. The main difference is that the value is
                initialized with the one that the user passed in, which forbids the passing of
                shader stage outputs as <literal>inout</literal> parameters.</para>
            <para>This particular function is semi-complex, as an optimization. Previously, our
                functions simply normalized the difference between the vertex position and the light
                position. In computing the attenuation, we need the distance between the two. And
                the process of normalization computes the distance. So instead of calling the GLSL
                function to normalize the direction, we do it ourselves, so that the distance is not
                computed twice (once in the GLSL function and once for us).</para>
            <para>The second line performs a dot product with the same vector. Remember that the dot
                product between two vectors is the cosine of the angle between them, multiplied by
                each of the lengths of the vectors. Well, the angle between a vector and itself is
                zero, and the cosine of zero is always one. So what you get is just the length of
                the two vectors times one another. And since the vectors are the same, the lengths
                are the same. Thus, the dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its
                length.</para>
            <para>To normalize a vector, we must divide the vector by it's length. And the length of
                    <varname>lightDifference</varname> is the square root of
                    <varname>lightDistanceSqr</varname>. The <function>inversesqrt</function>
                computes 1 / the square root of the given value, so all we need to do is multiply
                this with the <varname>lightDifference</varname> to get the light direction as a
                normalized vector. This value is written to our output variable.</para>
            <para>The next line computes our lighting term. Notice the use of the ?: operator. This
                works just like in C/C++. If we are using the square of the distance, that's what we
                store. Otherwise we get the square-root and store that.</para>
            <note>
                <para>The assumption in using ?: here is that only one or the other of the two
                    expressions will be evaluated. That's why the expensive call to
                        <function>sqrt</function> is done here. However, this may not be the case.
                    It is entirely possible (and quite likely) that the shader will always evaluate
                        <emphasis>both</emphasis> expressions and simply store one value or the
                    other as needed. So do not rely on such conditional logic to save
                    performance.</para>
            </note>
            <para>After that, things proceed as expected.</para>
            <para>Making these separate functions makes the main function look almost identical to
                prior versions:</para>
            <example>
                <title>Main Light Attenuation</title>
                <programlisting language="glsl">void main()
{
    vec3 cameraSpacePosition = CalcCameraSpacePosition();
    
    vec3 lightDir = vec3(0.0);
    vec4 attenIntensity = ApplyLightIntensity(cameraSpacePosition, lightDir);
    
    float cosAngIncidence = dot(normalize(vertexNormal), lightDir);
    cosAngIncidence = clamp(cosAngIncidence, 0, 1);
    
    outputColor = (diffuseColor * attenIntensity * cosAngIncidence) +
        (diffuseColor * ambientIntensity);
}</programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>Function calls appear very similar to C/C++, with the exceptions about parameters
                noted before. The camera-space position is determined. Then the light intensity,
                modified by attenuation, is computed. From there, things proceed as before.</para>
            <sidebar>
                <title>Alternative Attenuation</title>
                <para>As nice as these somewhat-realistic attenuation schemes are, it is often
                    useful to model light attenuation in a very different way. This is in no way
                    physically accurate, but it can look reasonably good.</para>
                <para>We simply do linear interpolation based on the distance. When the distance is
                    0, the light has full intensity. When the distance is beyond a given distance,
                    the maximum light range (which varies per-light), the intensity is 0.</para>
                <para>Note that <quote>reasonably good</quote> depends on your needs. The closer you
                    get in other ways to providing physically accurate lighting, the closer you get
                    to photorealism, the less you can rely on less accurate phenomena. It does no
                    good to implement a complicated sub-surface scattering lighting model that
                    includes Fresnel factors and so forth, while simultaneously using a simple
                    interpolation lighting attenuation model.</para>

                    <para>When we used model space-based lighting computations, we had to perform an
                        inverse on our matrix from the matrix stack to transform the light position
                        from camera space to model space. However, it would be entirely possible to
                        simply build an inverse matrix at the same time we build a regular matrix on
                        our matrix stack. The inverse of a rotation matrix is just the rotation
                        matrix with a negated angle; the inverse of a scale is just the
                        multiplicative inverse of the scales, and the inverse of the translation is
                        the negation of the translation vector.</para>
                    <para>To do this, you will need to modify the <classname>MatrixStack</classname>
                        class in a number of ways. It must store a second matrix representing the
                        accumulated inverse matrix. When a transformation command is given to the
                        stack, it must also generate the inverse matrix for this transform and
                            <emphasis>left multiply</emphasis> this into the accumulated inverse.
                        The push/pop will have to push/pop the inverse matrix as well. It can use
                        the same stack, so long as the pop function puts the two matrices in the
                        proper places.</para>

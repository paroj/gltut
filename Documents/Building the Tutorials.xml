    <title>Building the Tutorials</title>
    <para>This section describes how to build the tutorials.</para>
    <formalpara>
        <title>What You Need to Download</title>
        <para>Obviously, you will need a C++ compiler and build environment. You will also need the
            Windows or Linux operating systems, as these are the only OS's supported by the
            tutorials. Supported build environments include Visual Studio 2008/2010, Code::Blocks,
            and Linux-based GNU Makefiles. Other build systems may work, but they are not regularly
            tested.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <para>You will need to download the <link
            xlink:href="https://github.com/paroj/gltut/releases">source distribution</link>;
        download the .zip file with the highest version number. All of the libraries needed to build

        the tutorials are bundled as part of the distribution, so this is the only source code
        download you will need.</para>
    <para>You will also need to download the <link xlink:href="http://industriousone.com/premake"
            >Premake 4</link> utility for your platform of choice. Place the executable somewhere in
        your command path.</para>
    <para>You will need minimal familiarity with using the command line in order to build these
        tutorials. Also, any mention of directories is always relative to where you unzipped this
        distribution.</para>
    <formalpara>
        <title>Distribution File Layout</title>
        <para>The layout of the files in the tutorial directory is quite simple. The
                <filename>framework</filename> directory and all directories of the form
                <filename>Tut*</filename> contain the source code for the tutorials themselves. Each
                <filename>Tut*</filename> directory has the code for the various tutorials. The
                <filename>framework</filename> directory simply contains utility code that is
            commonly used by each tutorial.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <para>Each tutorial contains one or more projects; each project is referenced in the text for
        that tutorial.</para>
    <para>The <filename>Documents</filename> directory contains the source for the text
        documentation explaining how these tutorials work. This source is in xml files using the
        DocBook 5.0 format.</para>
    <para>The other directories either contain libraries used by the tutorials or data files that
        the tutorials load.</para>
    <formalpara>
        <title>Premake 4</title>
        <para>Premake is a utility like <link xlink:href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</link>: it
            generates build files for a specific platform. Unlike CMake, Premake is strictly a
            command-line utility. Premake's build scripts are written in the <link
                xlink:href="http://www.lua.org/home.html">Lua language</link>, unlike CMake's build
            scripts that use their own language.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <para>Note that Premake only generates build files; once the build files are created, you can
        use them as normal. It can generate project files for Visual Studio, <link
            xlink:href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Code::Blocks</link>, as well as GNU Makefiles.
        And unless you want to modify one of the tutorials, you only need to run Premake once for
        each tutorial.</para>
    <para>The Premake download comes as a pre-built executable for all platforms of interest,
        including Linux.</para>
    <formalpara>
        <title>Unofficial OpenGL SDK</title>
        <para>Bundled with the tutorials is the Unofficial OpenGL SDK (you do not need to download
            it separately). This is an aggregation of libraries, unifying a number of tools for
            developing OpenGL applications, all bound together with a unified build system. You do
            not need to download it; a version of the SDK is part of the tutorial distribution. The
            copy that comes with these tutorials does not contain the documentation or GLFW.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <para>The SDK library uses Premake to generate its build files. So, with
            <command>premake4.exe</command> in your path, open your command prompt and go to the
            <filename>glsdk</filename> directory. Type <userinput>premake4
                <replaceable>plat</replaceable></userinput>, where <replaceable>plat</replaceable>
        is the name of the platform of choice. For Visual Studio 2008, this would be
            <quote>vs2008</quote>; for VS2010, this would be <quote>vs2010.</quote> This will
        generate Visual Studio projects and solution files for that particular version.</para>
    <para>For GNU and makefile-based builds, this is <quote>gmake</quote>. This will generate a
        makefile. To build for debug, use <userinput>make config=debug</userinput>; similarly, to
        build for release, use <userinput>make config=release</userinput>.</para>
    <para>Using the generated build files, compile for both debug and release. You should build the
        entire solution; the tutorials use all of the libraries provided. Do not attempt to run the
        SDK from your IDE; it's just a set of libraries. All you have to do is compile them for
        debug and release.</para>
    <para>That there is also no need to execute <userinput>make install</userinput> or similar
        commands after building the SDK. The SDK is designed to be used where it is; it does not
        install itself to any system directories on your machine. Incidentally, neither do these
        tutorials.</para>
    <formalpara>
        <title>Tutorial Building and Running</title>
    </formalpara>
    <para>Each tutorial directory has a <filename>premake4.lua</filename> file; this file is used by
        Premake to generate the build files for that tutorial. Therefore, to build any tutorial, you
        need only go to that directory and type <userinput>premake4
            <replaceable>plat</replaceable></userinput>, then use those build files to build the
        tutorial.</para>
    <para>Each tutorial will generally have more than one source file and generate multiple
        executables. Each executable represents a different section of the tutorial, as explained in
        that tutorial's documentation.</para>
    <para>If you want to build all of the tutorials at once, go to the root directory of the
        distribution and use Premake on the <filename>premake4.lua</filename> file in that
        directory. It will put all of the tutorials into one giant project that you can
        build.</para>
    <para>If you look at any of the tutorial source files, you will not find the
            <function>main</function> function defined anywhere. This function is defined in
            <filename>framework/framework.cpp</filename>; it and all of the other source files in
        the <filename>framework</filename> directory is shared by every tutorial. It does the basic
        boilerplate work: creating a FreeGLUT window, etc. This allows the tutorial source files to
        focus on the useful OpenGL-specific code.</para>
    <para>Note that the framework project is a library, not an executable. So attempting to run the
        framework from your IDE of choice will not work. You must select one of the tutorial
        projects and set it to be the active project. Then you will be able to run that tutorial
        from the IDE.</para>

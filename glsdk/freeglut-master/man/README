This directory contains the GLUT manual pages.

These files are text files meant to be formatted with the Unix nroff/troff
or GNU groff typesetting programs.

Unix and Linux Users
---------------------
If you are a Unix or Linux users, these manual pages can be used by the
"man" command.  The location of Unix manual pages varies from Unix system
to system so check with your system documentation.  You may be able to
set your MANPATH environment variable to this directory.  Do "man man"
at a shell prompt for more information about viewing manual pages.

Windows Users
--------------
For Win32 users, these manual pages require extra software to format,
view, and/or print.  You will need a Win32 groff implementation and
typically a PostScript viewer.

Assuming that you have WinGROFF installed properly, you can generate a
formatted text version of these manual pages by executing the following
command at a DOS shell prompt (using the "glut.man" file as an example):

  groff -man -Tascii -P-buo glut.man > glut.txt

You can then view glut.txt into any text editor.

You can also generate PostScript versions of the manual pages using
WinGROFF as follows:

  groff -man glut.man > glut.ps

You can then view glut.ps with GSview.  You can print the PostScript
file to your Windows printer using GSview as well.

You can get a Win32 version of GNU groff from:

  ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Zeelenberg_Kees/V1.1/index.html

You can get the GSview PostScript previewer from:

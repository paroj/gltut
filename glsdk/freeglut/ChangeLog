	freeglut 3.6 changes:

	* New platforms: Nintendo Gamecube and Nintendo Wii.
	* Minimum cmake version raised to 3.1.
	* Make XInput an optional dependency.
	* Fix incorrect modifier bit mapped to GLUT_ACTIVE_SUPER on X11.
	* Add support for ARM64 MSVC targets.
	* Fix for unicode builds on windows.
	* Fix build on some versions of MinGW carrying an incorrect winuser.h.
	* Fix menu-related memory leak when an error occurs.
	* Various build improvements & fixes.

2022-10-07  John Tsiombikas <nuclear@member.fsf.org>

	freeglut 3.4 changes:

	* Add GLUT_ACTIVE_SUPER modifier, and corresponding GLUT_KEY_SUPER_L
	and GLUT_KEY_SUPER_R special keys. These map to Windows/Command keys.
	* Fix RGB mode (GLUT_RGBA) colors on 8bpp displays on windows
	(construct default RGB332 palette).
	* Fix indexed color context creation on X11 and windows (GLUT_INDEX).
	* Add missing colormap management functions for X11 and windows
	(glutSetColor, glutGetColor).
	* Fix crash when calling glutTimerFuncUcall.
	* Fix FreeBSD build by essentially disabling the joystick code for
	newer FreeBSD versions. It will eventually need to be replaced/fixed.
	* Add fallbacks for the old GLX (<1.3) context creation API
	(glXChooseVisual/glXCreateContext), makes us compatible with IRIX 5.x
	and other old UNIX systems.
	* Add fallbacks for OpenGL 1.0 (no vertex arrays/client state).
	* Use nanosleep instead of usleep on UNIX, which is more widely
	supported on old UNIX systems.
	* Fix build on X11 if GL_SAMPLES is not defined.
	* Fix overly strict context version checking on Android leading to
	context creation failure in some cases.
	* Fix GLUT_CURSOR_INFO on windows, should be IDC_HAND, not IDC_HELP.
	* Fix mismatched font declarations on X11.
	* Add alternative simple ways to build freeglut with native tools only,
	without having to use cmake.
	* Fix build on windows with cmake 3.0.0. Explicitly link with gdi32.
	* Fix build on MSVC 2005.
	* Fix build on MacOS X. Link with all the necessary X libraries.
	* Fix build on SGI IRIX.
	* Fix build on Android (mismatched function prototypes and missing
	glutCreateMenuUcall).
	* Add support for the ninja multi-config generator.
	* Removed spurious dependency on a C++ compiler. One of the demos was
	being compiled as C++ for no reason.
	* Silence unnecessary warnings when VBOs or GLSL are not available.
	* New demo programs: 3dview, keyboard, joystick.
	* Documentation: added MacOS X build instructions.
	* Made it possible to eventually support building freeglut as a single
	compilation unit, by avoiding name conflicts on static variables.
	* Other minor fixes.

2022-02-06  John Tsiombikas <nuclear@member.fsf.org>

	freeglut 3.2.2 changes:

	* Fix netbsd/aarch64 build by including sys/joystick.h instead of
	machine/joystick.h.
	* Fix build with gcc >= 10 which made -fno-common the default by no
	longer relying on COMMON symbols for globals.
	* Fix android build (default to FREEGLUT_GLES, and check for debug
	flags).
	* Add flat shading option to the shapes demo.
	* Fix crash when calling primitive drawing functions without creating a
	window first.
	* Dropped really old and unmaintained doc directory from the source
	tree.

2019-09-29  John Tsiombikas <nuclear@member.fsf.org>

	freeglut 3.2.1 changes:

	* Fixed failure to install glut.h when the "replace glut" build option
	is enabled.
	* Take into account CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR in the installed cmake module.
	* Fixed broken menu drawing when the user requests a core profile
	context.

2019-09-16  John Tsiombikas <nuclear@member.fsf.org>

	freeglut 3.2.0 changes:

	* Added new callback registration functions and corresponding callback
	types in the extended API, which take an extra user pointer, and pass
	it through to the callbacks (ucall API).
	* Added initial wayland support.
	* Fixed mousewheel callbacks on X11.
	* Fallback to non-sRGB context, instead of crashing, if the user
	requested SRGB but failed to get one.
	* Added GLUT_WINDOW_SRGB query to check if the context supports sRGB or
	the fallback was triggered.
	* Added missing spaceball support for windows.
	* Fixed crash on re-init after having set a custom cursor.
	* Added init error handler demo.
	* Added cmake package.
	* Added GLUT_ALLOW_NEGATIVE_WINDOW_POSITION option.
	* Fixed incorrect library name in pkg-config files when building with
	"replace glut" option disabled.
	* Added spaceball button definitions in the extended API header.
	* Added the "replace glut" option on windows too.
	* Fixed missing static defines from pkg-config.
	* Fixed incorrectly trying to install glut.h when the "replace glut"
	option is disabled.
	* Take "maximized" state into account when updating the visibility flag
	on windows.
	* Corrected "exit state" checking in the main loop, by placing the check
	after every glutMainLoopEvent invocation.
	* Added checking for the XInput dependency in cmake.
	* Fixed netbsd build (joystick code).
	* Fixed -pedantic GCC warnings on GNU/Linux.
	* Fixed PDB installation for nmake/msvc builds on windows.
	* Clear window work mask when marking it for destruction.
	* Fixed android build with clang.
	* Fixed GLUT_STEREO on nvidia windows drivers, which don't play well
	with fullscreen windows with frames.
	* Fixed original-GLUT compatibility in spaceball button numbering.
	* Dropped unnecessary X11 utility library dependencies.
	* Fixed namespace pollution due to some global symbols missing the fg
	prefix.
	* Fixed improper setting of the non-blocking flag in the joystick code
	on UNIX.

2012-01-09  John F. Fay <johnffay@cybertron.com>
	* Released freeglut 2.8.0 a few days ago and am restarting the ChangeLog
	* Added 'cmake' support
	* Moved source files from 'src' directory to 'src/Common' directory with
	an eye to moving platform-specific code to separate files in separate
	directories

2009-08-10  Sven Panne  <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* include/GL/freeglut_ext.h,include/GL/freeglut_std.h,src/freeglut_ext.c,
	src/freeglut_init.c,src/freeglut_internal.h,src/freeglut_state.c,
	src/freeglut_window.c,src/freeglutdll.def: Added support for sRGB
	framebuffers via the GLX_ARB_framebuffer_sRGB / WGL_ARB_framebuffer_sRGB
	extensions. Added support for context profiles via the new parts of the
	GLX_ARB_create_context / WGL_ARB_create_context extensions.

2009-06-11  Paul Blew  <paul.blew@northgatearinso.com>

	* replaced broken IDE based OpenWatcom build with a makefile based one

2009-06-11  Sven Panne  <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* include/GL/freeglut_std.h: Disable the ATEXIT_HACK for Watcom, their
	"exit" function has a different calling convention, leading to
	compilation errors.

2009-05-24  Sven Panne  <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* freeglut_static_vs2008.vcproj,freeglut_vs2008.vcproj,
	  freeglut_vs2008.sln,freeglut_vs2008_static.sln: Move all files related
	  to Visual Studio 2008 into 2 directories, one for the normal DLL
	  build, and one for the static build. We should do this for other IDEs,
	  too.

2009-05-22  Sven Panne  <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* include/GL/freeglut_std.h: Avoid warnings when the ATEXIT_HACK is used
	  with GCC, making the hack even uglier.

	* include/GL/freeglut_std.h,src/freeglut_init.c,src/freeglut_internal.h,
	  src/freeglut_menu.c,src/freeglut_window.c,src/freeglutdll.def: Added the
	  ugly ATEXIT_HACK from GLUT 3.7, making freeglut binary compatible with the
	  GLUT DLLs out in the wild.

	* src/freeglutdll.def: Removed obsolete lines. Fixed version number.

	* freeglut_vs2008.vcproj: Use our module definition file, so we get
	  undecorated names in the resulting DLL, just like the classic GLUT DLL
	  from Nate Robins.

2009-04-05  Sven Panne  <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* Makefile.am: Added more project/workspace/... files to distribution.
	* .cvsignore,doc/.cvsignore,include/.cvsignore,include/GL/.cvsignore,
	  progs/.cvsignore,progs/demos/.cvsignore,
	  progs/demos/CallbackMaker/.cvsignore,progs/demos/Fractals/.cvsignore,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/.cvsignore,progs/demos/Lorenz/.cvsignore,
	  progs/demos/One/.cvsignore,progs/demos/shapes/.cvsignore,
	  src/.cvsignore: Removed remnants of CVS.

2009-03-30  Sven Panne  <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3.c: Make the example fully
	  OpenGL-3.1-compliant.

2009-03-27  Sven Panne  <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3.c: Make Visual C happy by
	  including stddef.h and explicitly marking some literals as float.

2009-03-26  Sven Panne  <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* src/freeglut_init.c,src/freeglut_input_devices.c: Unbreak the build:
	  C++ style comments are not allowed in ISO C90

2009-03-19  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_input_devices.c: Fixing "freeglut_input_devices.c" for
	  MSVS2005 and later per e-mail from Diederick Niehorster dated Thu
	  3/19/2009 6:57 AM

2009-03-17  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_input_devices.c: Removing some build
	  warnings from deprecated functions for VS2008 per e-mail from
	  Diederick Niehorster dated Tue 3/10/2009
	* freeglut_static_vs2008.vcproj, freeglut_vs2008.sln,
	  freeglut_vs2008.vcproj,
	  progs/demos/CallbackMaker/CallbackMakerStatic_vs2008.vcproj,

	  progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3_vs2008.vcproj: Adding Visual
	  Studio 2008 solution and project files

2009-03-16  Sven Panne  <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* src/freeglut_init.c,src/freeglut_window.c: Set the default number of
	  samples per pixel to 4 and actually use the value set with
	  glutSetOption(GLUT_MULTISAMPLE,...) in Windows code. Previously the
	  Windows code used a hardwired value of 4 and the GLX code had a
	  default of 0, neither made much sense. Similarly, set the default
	  number of auxiliary buffers to 1 and use that value when GLUT_AUX is
	  used. Note: There latter token has the same value as GLUT_AUX1, and
	  for historical reasons we seem to have 2 APIs to set the number of
	  auxiliary buffers: Explicitly using GLUT_AUX1 ... GLUT_AUX4, and using
	  a combination of GLUT_AUX with glutSetOption. The default of 1 ensures
	  consistent behaviour in both cases.
	* src/freeglut_state.c: Added GLUT_AUX and GLUT_MULTISAMPLE as possible
	  parameters for glutGet, making things more symmetric with
	  glutSetOption.
	* src/freeglutdll.def: Added missing API entries.

2009-03-10  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* progs/demos/demos.dsw: Adding the "smooth_opengl3" demo

2009-03-09  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* include/GL/freeglut_std.h: Making the definition of
	  "WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN" conditional to enhance compatibility with GLEW
	  per suggestion by Diederick C. Niehorster in e-mail dated Mon 3/9/2009
	  8:06 AM
	* progs/demos/Fractals/fractals.c: Setting the "fractals" demo initial
	  number of levels to 4 per suggestion from Diederick C. Niehorster
	  [diederick@niehorster.eu] in e-mail dated Mon 3/9/2009 5:29 AM

2009-03-01  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* progs/demos/CallbackMaker/CallbackMaker.c,
	  progs/demos/Lorenz/lorenz.c, progs/demos/shapes/shapes.c: Fixing
	  Microsoft compatibility with the new "vsnprintf" by putting an
	  underscore in front of it if WIN32 is defined but __CYGWIN__ is not

2009-03-01  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* configure.ac: We do not depend on GLU anymore
	* README.win32: Added notes for building under Cygwin
	* src/Makefile.am: To build shared libraries on Windows, one has to
	  declare explicitly that there are no undefined symbols during linking.
	  No idea why, but this seems to be the only way to enable this on
	  Cygwin via -mno-cygwin. Hopefully this won't cause problems on other
	  platforms (which has to be tested).
	* progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3.c: Windows fun again: Use
	  the correct calling convention for OpenGL extension entries.

2009-02-28  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3.c: When -mno-cygwin is used,
	  we get ancient GL headers, so be a bit more conservative.
	* progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c,
	  progs/demos/Lorenz/lorenz.c, progs/demos/shapes/shapes.c:
	  _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks and its header are Microsoft-specific, e.g. Cygwin
	  doesn't provide them.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Do not try to destroy a GLX context when there
	  is none, e.g. when glXCreateContextAttribsARB is not there.
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Use snprintf or _snprintf instead of the
	  potentially dangerous sprintf to avoid warnings.
	  
	  NOTE: Due to excessive use of #ifdefs, the joystick code is on the
	  border of being unmaintainable! I could only check that it compiles
	  cleanly on my Linux box. Others should test this on their platforms
	  (Windows, Mac OS X, *BSD) to make sure that nothing has been broken.
	* progs/demos/CallbackMaker/CallbackMaker.c,
	  progs/demos/Lorenz/lorenz.c, progs/demos/shapes/shapes.c: Use
	  vsnprintf instead of the potentially dangerous sprintf to avoid
	  warnings. Using snprintf directly would be a little bit more tricky,
	  because once again Microsoft decided to avoid followind standards and
	  provide _snprintf instead. We could use this, too, but this would
	  require an additional autoconf check, which I'd like to avoid, if
	  possible.
	  
	  Note: If VS *still* issues warnings, but this time about vsnprintf,
	  somebody should add some pragmas or whatever is needed to shut up that
	  warning, it would be silly.
	* progs/demos/Lorenz/lorenz.c: Position the distance message closer to
	  the middle of the window, it has been far, far off to the upper right.
	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Synched version number with configure.ac. We
	  should better remove this redundancy and calculate this from
	  configure.ac directly.

2009-02-19  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3.dsp,
	  progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3Static.dsp: Fixing the
	  DOS/Linux line ending problems in the progs/demos/smooth_opengl3
	  project files

2009-02-18  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_window.c: Fixing a build error caused by a variable
	  declaration being out of place

2009-02-15  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3.c: Final changes to make the
	  example fully OpenGL-3.0-compliant:
	  
	  * Use vertex attribute arrays.
	  
	  * Use our own projection matrix.
	  
	  * Do not use deprecated vertex/fragment shader variables.
	* progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3.c: Use GLSL shaders (still
	  1.20, though). Dump GL info.
	* progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3.c: Added a commandline
	  option for 'classic' contexts. Aesthetic changes.
	* progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3.c: Use VBOs in new example.
	  Added a few comments.

2009-02-14  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* configure.ac, progs/demos/Makefile.am, progs/demos/smooth_opengl3,
	  progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3.c,
	  progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3.dsp,
	  progs/demos/smooth_opengl3/smooth_opengl3Static.dsp: Initial version
	  of a fully OpenGL-3.0-compliant of the famous smooth.c from the Red
	  Book. What has been done already:
	  
	  * Explicitly request a forward-compatible 3.0 context
	  
	  * Report GL errors, if any, at a few crucial places
	  
	  * Replaced gluOrtho2D with a home-grown matrix + glLoadMatrixf
	  
	  What remains to be done:
	  
	  * Use vertex shaders and fragment shaders
	  
	  * Use vertex buffer objects

2009-02-13  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* README: Mention autogen.sh
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Synchronized WGL behavior with GLX
	  implementation: Do not call the new context creation API when it is
	  not required. Fixing a bug in a previous commit on the way... :-}
	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_window.c: More refactorings:
	  Removed useless return value. Simplified control structures even more.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Refactoring only (replace nested conditionals
	  with guard clauses), making the normal path of execution much clearer.
	* configure.ac: We have added some API entries, so we have to update
	  library version information conforming to
	  http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html
	* autogen.sh, configure.ac: Avoid CR\LF vs. LF troubles when using
	  TortoiseSVN plus Cygwin.
	* .: Ignore config.lt, too. It seems to be generated by recent
	  autotools.

2009-02-13  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_window.c:
	  Adding OpenGL 3.0 context detection for Windows per e-mail from Paul
	  Martz dated Thu 2/12/2009 9:03 AM (more or less)

2009-02-03  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* README: Adding some instructions about building on a *nix platform to
	  the 'README' file
	* include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, src/freeglut_main.c: Removing some errant
	  tabs, fixing ticket #2137721, and adding special-key capability to
	  recognizing the NumLock, Delete, and keypad '5' keys
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c, src/freeglut_main.c: A further response to
	  bug [ 1804696 ] Warnings when building on OpenSolaris -- per comment
	  by Nigel Stewart on that bug report

2009-02-02  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_joystick.c: Fixing bug [ 1804696
	  ] Warnings when building on OpenSolaris as updated 2/2/09 by Nigel
	  Stewart

2008-11-20  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* src/freeglut_glutfont_definitions.c, src/freeglut_internal.h: Yet
	  another try to make the font definitions compile on all platforms.

2008-11-17  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_glutfont_definitions.c, src/freeglut_internal.h: Allowing
	  "freeglut" to compile without errors under *nix. Before this, there
	  were problems with conflicting definitions of the GLUT font
	  definitions.

2008-11-06  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Ooops, forgot one file in the previous commit
	  (fix for "--without-x").
	* configure.ac: Use autoconf to detect gettimeofday instead of broken
	  #ifdef.
	  
	  Note: freeglut compiles under Cygwin now, even when "--without-x" is
	  used for configuration.
	* configure.ac: We need to link against winmm under Cygwin when
	  --without-x is used to get timeBeginPeriod, timeEndPeriod, joyGetPosEx
	  and joyGetDevCaps.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Fixed first parameter of CreateWindow call,
	  used for multisampling on Windows. It compiles, but it is otherwise
	  untested.

2008-11-05  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* src/freeglut_misc.c: Be conservative about the presence of
	  GL_TABLE_TOO_LARGE.
	* src/freeglut_glutfont_definitions.c, src/freeglut_stroke_mono_roman.c,
	  src/freeglut_stroke_roman.c: freeglut_internal.h needs some GL types,
	  but it is not self-contained. TODO: Move freeglut.h #include into
	  freeglut_internal.h itself?
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Removed the annoying "Unable to create direct
	  context rendering..." warning, it served no real purpose, and on some
	  platforms there simply is no such thing as a direct context.
	* progs/demos/CallbackMaker, progs/demos/Fractals,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random, progs/demos/Lorenz, progs/demos/One,
	  progs/demos/shapes: Ignore *.exe
	* src/freeglut_ext.c: Handle new glutInitContext* API entries in
	  glutGetProcAddress
	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Make freeglut compile under Cygwin, which has
	  an ancient GLX header

2008-11-02  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, src/freeglut_init.c,
	  src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_state.c, src/freeglut_window.c:
	  Added OpenGL 3.0 context creation API entries
	  
	  glutInitContextVersion, glutInitContextFlags
	  
	  and their related constants
	  
	  GLUT_INIT_MAJOR_VERSION GLUT_INIT_MINOR_VERSION GLUT_INIT_FLAGS
	  
	  GLUT_DEBUG GLUT_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE
	  
	  Note that this works with GLX only currently, the glutInitContext* API
	  entries have no effect for WGL yet.
	  
	  TODO: Centralize the context creation code for WGL (the harder part)
	  and use the new wglCreateContextAttribsARB API entry (the easy part,
	  re-use most of the GLX code).
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Refactored GLX context creation into a single
	  function, centralizing things to be changed for OpenGL 3.0 context
	  creation and removing some cut-n-paste.
	* src/freeglut_ext.c, src/freeglut_internal.h: Make a
	  wgl/glXGetProcAddress abstraction available internally. We will need
	  this to get the new context creation function.
	* src/freeglut_misc.c: Do not depend on GLU, it will vanish in the
	  future, at least in its current form.
	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Removed superfluous #includes.
	* configure.ac: Fix for bug #1709675 ("probably not be so
	  ISO-conformant"): The C compiler flag -Werror is not used by default
	  anymore, a separate configure flag --enable-warnings-as-errors has
	  been introduced for this purpose, which is off by default.
	* configure.ac: Added AM_PROG_CC_C_O to configure.ac, removing a warning
	  during autogen.sh. This flag seems to be necessary for per-target
	  flags (used in demo programs) nowadays.

2008-07-21  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Implementing a patch from Jocelyn
	  Frechot (thank you, Jocelyn) that "should enable the XInput extension

	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Removing more Win64 build warnings from
	  joystick code

2007-09-30  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Removing the final compiler warning when building
	  on Win75 -- thank you, Antonio Mattos.

2007-09-29  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Removing the remaining compiler warnings from
	  the cursor code, thanks to Antonio Mattos of Brazil. The double
	  type-casting is needed because of a bug in the new MSVC; there is a
	  discussion on the web on this subject.

2007-09-25  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Changing the cursor definition macro for newer
	  versions of MSVC -- thanks to "Mattos" of Brazil
	* src/freeglut_window.c: More changes for Jocelyn Frechot's
	  multisampling changes. The library builds now. It still needs some
	  testing with sample cases under X11.

2007-09-23  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_window.c: Fixing a remaining bug in the multisampling
	  change ... there may be more ...

2007-09-22  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_state.c,
	  src/freeglut_structure.c, src/freeglut_window.c: Putting in Jocelyn
	  Frechot's X11 visual context changes. THIS WILL BREAK THE BUILD as I
	  am unable to test it on a Linux machine here. Somebody please test it
	  for me.

2007-09-21  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_misc.c:
	  Removing compiler warnings in MSVC 2005 build
	* include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, src/freeglut_init.c: Implementing Larry
	  Ramey's "glutExit" feature (see e-mails from him on 11/9/05, 6/28/06)

2007-09-19  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* include/GL/freeglut_std.h, src/freeglut_window.c: Implementing first
	  part of Windows version of "GLUT_CAPTIONLESS" and "GLUT_BORDERLESS"
	  per feature request "[ 1197016 ] need GLUT_CAPTIONLESS window option".
	  Needs more work; menus are slightly mispositioned, X11 version does
	  not support it, banner appears at beginning but disappears on window
	  resize. But this is a start.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Fixing Linux key-repeat mode bug reported in "[
	  1796845 ] Keyboard events are lost when key repeat is enabled."

	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Adding Takeshi Nishimura's Feature Request "[
	  1045202 ] Cope with a menu with many items" -- sorry it took so long.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Addressing Feature Request #1307049 that
	  "freeglut" should return 0 if "glutGetWindow" is called without a
	  prior call to "glutInit", rather than terminating on error.
	* freeglut.dep, freeglut.mak, freeglut_static.dep, freeglut_static.mak:
	  Added Windows "nmake" Makefiles and dependency files for the two
	  "freeglut" projects in accordance with Feature Request #1454543

2007-09-16  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_window.c: Fixing bug #1688954, submitted in Marcy '07. I
	  changed "FREEGLUT" to _T("FREEGLUT") and nothing changed on my Windows
	  XP system. If this will allow it to work on Vista, then in it goes.
	* src/freeglut_gamemode.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c,

	* FrequentlyAskedQuestions: Adding a Frequently Asked Questions file

2006-09-28  Joe Krahn <krahn@niehs.nih.gov>

	* src/freeglut_state.c, src/freeglut_window.c: Removed incorrect comment
	  about internal WGL/ARB definitions. I actually had put those comments
	  in because I had meant to go back and re-check the WGL extension. But,
	  maybe locally defined extensions should be kept in a separate include
	  file?

	* include/GL/freeglut_std.h, src/freeglut_joystick.c,

	* src/freeglut_window.c: Fixing a typo bug in the display mode checking
	  (removing multisampling if it is not supported)

2006-09-25  Joe Krahn <krahn@niehs.nih.gov>

	* src/freeglut_state.c: Fixed a small mistake in the previous commit for
	  glutGet.
	* src/freeglut_state.c: Added proper support for number of mouse buttons
	  in X11, and a keyboard in Windows CE. Also, several glutGet results
	  returning TRUE/FALSE were changed to 1/0, because the actual return
	  type is int (although they are technically the same in practice).

2006-09-24  Joe Krahn <krahn@niehs.nih.gov>

	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c:
	  Converted Time counter to a uniform unsigned long it value. The
	  initialized flag was redundant with the main Initialized flag, and
	  conversion of timeval to milliseconds in POSIX makes the code cleaner.
	  Timeval has a longer range, but the time value is already limited by
	  the GLUT API.

2006-09-23  Joe Krahn <krahn@niehs.nih.gov>

	* src/freeglut_gamemode.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c:

	  Structure.GameModeWindow

2006-09-21  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* ChangeLog, include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, include/GL/freeglut_std.h: Moved
	  GLUT_INIT_STATE to <GL/freeglut_ext.h>, it is not part of the original
	  GLUT.
	* ., .cvsignore, ChangeLog, INSTALL, autogen.sh, install-sh,
	  mkinstalldirs: Simply use autoreconf in autogen.sh, it is much simpler

	  INSTALL, install-sh and mkinstalldirs, they are either unused or
	  automatically generated by autogen.sh.

2005-10-06  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_window.c: Implementing Stereo in Windows

2005-09-04  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

2005-07-14  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* src/freeglut_input_devices.c: Nuked useless bit-fiddling, pointed out

	  definition into our code... :-]
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglutdll.def: Synched the DLL definitions with

	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_cursor.c: Fixed the GLUT_CURSOR_INHERIT logic
	  once again...
	  
	  Note that this commit is untested, but at least it looks better than
	  before. We really a need a cursor test program.

2005-07-13  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Fixing a cursor bug in \"GLUT_CURSOR_INHERIT\"

2005-07-13  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac: Improve autoconf magic: To detect headers
	  like GL/gl.h, it might be necessary to temporarily use the X11 flags
	  found by AC_PATH_XTRA.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_joystick.c: Avoid gcc warnings for some
	  joystick code (e.g. on Solaris).
	* src/freeglut_input_devices.c: Tiny cleanup only...
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_input_devices.c: Solaris doesn't have
	  cfmakeraw, but it is only a convenience function for some
	  bit-fiddling, anyway.

2005-07-08  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* ChangeLog, include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, src/freeglut_ext.c,
	  src/freeglut_internal.h: Made all the "glutJoystickXXX" functions part
	  of the freeglut extensions. If this is not what we want, we can easily
	  #ifdef this away again...
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_geometry.c: Made a few global arrays "static",
	  avoiding namespace pollution. The only externally visible symbols
	  should either be from the GLUT API ("glutXXX") or internal freeglut
	  entities ("fgYYY"). Reformatted things a bit on the way.

2005-07-06  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_main.c: We only have pending redisplay
	  callbacks when the window wants to be redisplayed *and* it is visible.
	  Otherwise we won't redraw, anyway, and immediately discover that
	  there's still something to do, etc. etc., leading to 100% CPU load.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_main.c: Removed redundant code.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_init.c: X11 only: Destroy the global menu
	  rendering context when deinitializing. The visual/context handling for
	  menus is still rather obscure, though...
	* progs/demos/Lorenz/lorenz.c: Reverting previous commit: %lf is a valid
	  format specifier for the scanf familiy of functions only, not for the
	  printf family.

2005-07-05  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Implementing the new menu context variable names
	  in Windows ...
	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Changing a comment ... nothing big.
	* progs/demos/Lorenz/lorenz.c: Fixing output formats ... nothing big

2005-07-05  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_state.c, src/freeglut_window.c: X11 only: Free
	  XVisualInfo structures when they are not needed anymore, fixing a
	  space leak. Not perfect for menus yet...
	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_window.c: Tiny change to make
	  grep's life easier: Rename the fields of the menu context. Not really
	  worth a ChangeLog entry...
	  
	  IMHO it looks like we could kill the whole MenuContext stuff, it is of
	  no use currently and some things look strange, like e.g. having a
	  context per menu. The latter is not OK when a menu is attached to
	  multiple windows.

2005-07-02  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h,
	  src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_state.c: Handle modifiers in
	  MotionNotify events, too. This fixes bug #1227920 (glutGetModifiers
	  not set/allowed in mouse callbacks). In addition, some related cleanup
	  has been done.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_joystick.c: Partial fixes for bug #1218900
	  (freeglut-2.4.0 on FreeBSD).
	* ChangeLog, Makefile.am: Remove wrong "execute" bits when creating a
	  distribution. This fixes bug #961938 (Executable bit set on non exe
	  files).
	* configure.ac: Tiny cosmetic change, not worth a ChangeLog entry.
	* ChangeLog: Added John's missing ChangeLog entry.

2005-07-01  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* freeglut.dsp, freeglut_static.dsp: Adding the
	  \"freeglut_input_devices.c\" file to the Windows project files

2005-07-01  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Some steps toward
	  compilation under MinGW. Note that there are still linking troubles
	  for the examples.
	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Fixed #ifdef for ChangeDisplaySettingsEx
	  prototype.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_input_devices.c: Silenced a signed/unsigned
	  mismatched via a cast.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_internal.h: MinGW is lacking a prototype for
	  ChangeDisplaySettingsEx, so supply one in this case. Note that this
	  should better be handled via autoconf than via cpp.
	* ChangeLog, Makefile.am: Removed redundant files from EXTRA_DIST.

2005-06-30  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Ooops, forgot to set the current window in the
	  last commit. I'll have to test better before committing... :-]
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_main.c: When a window is iconified, only an
	  UnmapNotify is sent, not a VisibilityNotify, so we have to handle the
	  window status callback in the former case, too. This fixes bug #763442
	  (Call the visibility callback when minimizing a window).
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_main.c: Cleaned up
	  CreateNotify/ConfigureNotify handling.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Ooops, forgot to dump a few fields in some
	  events...
	* ChangeLog, configure.ac, src/freeglut_main.c: Added --enable-debug
	  configure flag. Currently it only turns on X11 event tracing, but in
	  the future we could add more.
	  
	  Note: freeglut_main.c could benefit from some restructuring to clean
	  up the #ifdefs and cut down the sizes of some extremely long
	  functions.
	* ., .cvsignore: Ignore files generated during RPM build.

2005-06-23  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* doc/freeglut_user_interface.html: Fixing the documentation regarding

	* src/freeglut_input_devices.c: New file for Joe Krahn\'s dials input
	  device

2005-06-22  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_geometry.c: Fixing a bug in the Sierpinski sponge code
	  that made the application crash if called with number of levels < 0
	* src/Makefile.am, src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h,
	  src/freeglut_joystick.c, src/freeglut_state.c: Joe Krahn\'s input
	  (dials) device implementation.

2005-06-14  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* ChangeLog, freeglut.spec: Added an RPM spec file based on the one
	  shipped with SuSE 9.3.

2005-06-10  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac: Release of 2.4.0

2005-06-02  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac, src/freeglut_internal.h: 2.4.0 Release

2005-05-26  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Takeshi Nishimura\'s changes to make the Windows
	  mouse wheel/button mapping match that of X11; also fixing a typo in
	  the associated mouse callback argument list

2005-05-26  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac: 2.4.0 RC4 updates
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Fix joysticks so they are polled by their timer
	  correctly. (Dan Torop)

2005-05-24  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_gamemode.c: The original glutEnterGameMode()
	  returns the window id of the game mode window, not TRUE/FALSE, we
	  should better follow that. Note that most man pages claim that this
	  function returns void, but this is definitely wrong.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_gamemode.c, src/freeglut_main.c: When
	  switching to game mode under X11, no ConfigureNotify event will happen
	  and consequently no reshape callback will ever be called via the
	  normal mechanism. To fix this, note that the game mode window needs to
	  be resized and handle this before redraw.

2005-05-22  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_ext.c: Guarantee consistency of
	  names/addresses in glutGetProcAddress by using a macro. In addition,
	  this avoids any non-constant initializer issues which might be raised
	  when using WinDoze GCCs. The additional code overhead is negligible,
	  at least for x86 (a few instructions per name).
	* ChangeLog, configure.ac: Lowering minimum autoconf version required.

2005-05-20  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog: Tag for 2.4.0 RC3
	* ChangeLog: Notes

2005-05-19  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* src/freeglut_gamemode.c: Fixed SF bug #1204256: Off-by-one error in
	  X11 mode switching. The code which changes the X11 video mode has an
	  off-by-one error, resulting in a wrong mode or segfault. I've
	  refactored the code slightly to make it hopefully clearer what's going
	  on and corrected some #ifdefs on the way. Now at least the "One" demo
	  works for me.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Fixed SF bug #1204261: Mini space leak when
	  creating an X11 window (X11 text property values have to be freed
	  after using them)

2005-05-18  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_gamemode.c: Removing a C++ comment and simplifying the
	  string handling

	  on all operating systems.

2005-05-16  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog: Mark for 2.4 RC 2

2005-05-13  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Removing two unused variables so this will
	  compile on Linux with -Wall

2005-05-12  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* ChangeLog: Updating the ChangeLog ...
	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_menu.c:
	  Takeshi Nishimura\'s menu changes--menus should now work properly. Use
	  the GLUT \"GLUTmech\" and \"walker\" demos to test them.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Takeshi Nishimura\'s menu fixes

2005-05-09  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	  implemented wire mode for that shape.
	* ChangeLog, progs/demos/shapes/shapes.c, src/freeglut_internal.h,
	  src/freeglut_main.c: Necessary compilation fixes for newer GCCs (e.g.
	  3.3.5, 4.0). Side effect: The shapes demo has a new 'i' key now.

2005-05-05  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* ChangeLog: Updated the ChangeLog again ...

2005-05-04  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* progs/demos/shapes/shapes.c: Replacing the original \"freeglut\"
	  \"shapes\" demo with the much snazzier OpenGLUT \"shapes\" demo. Many
	  thanks to the OpenGLUT community for writing it. The copyright notice
	  stays in the program.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Changing hard-coded constant (number of mouse
	  buttons = 3) to a \"glutDeviceGet\" call in two places under X11
	* src/freeglutdll.def: Changing the version number from 2.0 to 2.4.0 ...
	  do we need to add any new interface functions?
	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Removing an unused variable
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Adding a comment on why \"freeglut\" differs
	  from GLUT in a particular way
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Removing an unused function

	* ChangeLog, TODO, src/freeglut_window.c: Updating the ChangeLog and
	  TODO files in preparation for the upcoming release

2005-04-29  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Adding a \"TODO\" comment about dynamically
	  allocating joystick buttonj and axis arrays
	* ChangeLog: Updationg the ChangeLog ...

2005-04-28  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* README.win32: Adding a \"README.Win32\" file with instructions on how
	  to install \"freeglut\" under Windows.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Adding Window Exit event handling to the Windows
	  code; also adding a note that eventually it would be good to handle
	  the Window Entry event

2005-04-27  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_window.c: Fixing bug [ 1111218 ] fullscreen not working
	  Better late than never.
	* src/freeglut_init.c: Fixing Bug Report [ 1160442 ]
	  glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) is too granular

2005-04-26  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_structure.c: Fixing the

	  \"freeglut\" to compile with GCC 4.0
	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Fixing erroneous implementation of Takeshi\'s fix
	* src/Makefile.am: Changing include path from relative to absolute to
	  support off-directory builds (Yuri D\'Elia, March 22, 5:59 PM)

2005-04-25  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* ChangeLog: Updating the ChangeLog ... it seems to be something of a
	  stepchild if we\'re not careful.

2005-04-22  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Yuri D\'Elia\'s changes to get the virtual
	  maximum screen extent instead of the actual screen size.
	* src/freeglut_gamemode.c: Yuri D\'Elia\'s changes to the game mode
	  window
	* src/freeglut_structure.c: Change a hard-coded number to a defined
	  constant and add some initializations
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Removing duplicate cursor code. This and the
	  previous change (in freeglut_main.c) apparently got combined.
	* ChangeLog: Updating the ChangeLog to reflect activity over the past
	  few months
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c, src/freeglut_cursor.c,
	  src/freeglut_display.c, src/freeglut_gamemode.c,
	  src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_menu.c,
	  src/freeglut_misc.c, src/freeglut_state.c, src/freeglut_structure.c,
	  src/freeglut_window.c: Trying again to change \"fgStructure.Window\"
	  to \"fgStructure.CurrentWindow\" and \"fgStructure.Menu\" to
	  \"fgStructure.CurrentMenu\" for easier maintenance.

2005-04-15  John F. Fay <john.fay.ctr@eglin.af.mil>

	* ChangeLog: Updating the ChangeLog as a means of testing pCVSc
	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Testing!

2005-03-23  Brian Paul

2005-02-16  Brian Paul

	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_menu.c,
	  src/freeglut_structure.c, src/freeglut_window.c: fixes for menus being
	  attached to multiple buttons/windows (John Fay)
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: added error check (John Fay)

2005-02-15  Brian Paul

	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_window.c: AUX buffers for Windows
	  (John Fay)

2005-02-11  Brian Paul

	* include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_window.c:
	  Aux color buffer support. Pass one of GLUT_AUX[1234] to
	  glutInitDisplayMode. Only implemented/tested on GLX, not Windows.
	* include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, src/freeglut_ext.c,
	  src/freeglut_internal.h: Fix object/function pointer inconsistencies
	  which are a problem for gcc 3.4.2. Added GLUTproc type, returned by
	  glutGetProcAddress().

2005-01-23  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* configure.ac: autoconf 2.58 is enough
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c, src/freeglut_internal.h: Stylistic change
	  only (added "do { ... } while( 0 )" around multi-statement macros)
	* configure.ac, src/freeglut_joystick.c, src/freeglut_main.c: Testing
	  for errno.h is overkill. :-)
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c, src/freeglut_main.c: Windows platforms only:
	  Merged some cursor-related code from John Fay (with minor changes)

2005-01-05  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* src/freeglut_ext.c, src/freeglut_font.c, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_state.c, src/freeglut_window.c: Hopefully removed all
	  damage done by commits without merge
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_cursor.c: Reworked the X11 part of
	  glutSetCursor, fixing bug #764187 (Variable mouse pointers don't work)
	  on the way: * Use slightly more compatible cursor shapes for
	  GLUT_CURSOR_RIGHT_ARROW and GLUT_CURSOR_LEFT_ARROW. * Refactored and
	  fixed the erroneous code for GLUT_CURSOR_NONE. * Removed the incorrect
	  use of XFreeCursor and use a cache of cursors instead. Cursors are
	  never freed now, we could do this e.g. via reference countig if this
	  is really needed. * Fixed error handling. * Unknown cursor types are
	  an error now. * Now the window state always corresponds to the wanted
	  cursorID, even in the case of GLUT_CURSOR_FULL_CROSSHAIR.
	  
	  NOTE: I am not sure where the cursor cache should really reside,
	  currently it is simply a file-local variable.

2005-01-03  Sven Panne <sven.panne@aedion.de>

	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_gamemode.c: Fixed part of bug #926883 (Video
	  mode matching code, memory leaks, fullscreen), i.e. issue warnings
	  when XF86VidModeFOO fails.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_gamemode.c: (234) Fixed part of bug #926883
	  (Video mode matching code, memory leaks, fullscreen): Now we first try
	  to get an exact mode match, ignoring the refresh rate if none could be
	  found. This way the X11 part and the WinDoze behave similarly. NOTE:
	  We still don't behave like GLUT, because it has a wider notion of
	  "best" match. We have to refactor and extend freeglut quite a bit to
	  do that.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_gamemode.c: Fixed part of bug #926883 (Video
	  mode matching code, memory leaks, fullscreen), i.e. memory leak caused
	  by not freeing the mode lines returned by XF86VidModeGetAllModeLines
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_window.c: Improved error message a bit when no
	  suitable visual could be found (X11 only).
	* configure.ac, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c: autoconf'd
	  vfprintf
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Removed redundant #include
	* ChangeLog, configure.ac, src/freeglut_joystick.c, src/freeglut_main.c:
	  autoconf'd <errno.h> handling and removed an unused '#include
	  <sys/stat.h>'
	* configure.ac, src/freeglut_joystick.c, src/freeglut_main.c: autoconf'd
	  <limits.h> and <sys/param.h> handling, removing MIN/MAX macros on the
	  way.
	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Cosmetics.
	* configure.ac, src/freeglut_joystick.c: autoconf'd <fcntl.h> and
	  <sys/ioctl.h> handling
	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_joystick.c, src/freeglut_main.c:
	  Improved <sys/typed.h> / <unistd.h> handling as suggested by the
	  autoconf docs.
	* configure.ac, progs/demos/Lorenz/lorenz.c, src/freeglut_internal.h,
	  src/freeglut_main.c: Fixed <sys/time.h> / <time.h> handling as
	  suggested by the autoconf docs.
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c, src/freeglut_cursor.c,
	  src/freeglut_display.c, src/freeglut_ext.c, src/freeglut_font.c,
	  src/freeglut_font_data.c, src/freeglut_gamemode.c,

	  src/freeglut_structure.c, src/freeglut_teapot.c,
	  src/freeglut_videoresize.c, src/freeglut_window.c: Moved '#include
	  "config.h"' to freeglut_internal.h, we will need it there soon and it
	  makes everything a bit shorter.
	* ChangeLog: Resurrected my recent additions which were nuked by the
	  previous commit, adding the latest change on the way. :-(
	* acconfig.h: Removed acconfig.h, it is deprecated and we don't need it.
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c, src/freeglut_font.c, src/freeglut_init.c,
	  src/freeglut_structure.c: Make it compile again with "-Wall -pedantic
	  -Werror", redoing quite a few things I've fixed already a few days
	  ago. Have today's commits been done by copying instead of merging? :-(

2005-01-03  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_menu.c,

	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_main.c: Fixed first bug of #1064195 (two
	  things when using signals): Don't issue a warning about select when a
	  non-blocked signal was caught. This makes sense and is more compatible
	  with GLUT.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_font.c: Fixed bug #1040435 (glutBitmapString()
	  bug).
	* ChangeLog: Alas, the ChangeLog has not the usual ChangeLog format, so
	  tell (X)Emacs about that fact.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_window.c: Fixed bug #1045054 (KeyReleaseMask
	  typo).
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_state.c: Fixed bug #1087642

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Repeat-key handling for Win32 Utilise both
	  FreeGLUT state and per-window filtering modes

2004-03-15  rkrolib

	* ChangeLog: Forgot to update the ChangeLog for the benefit of those who
	  do not have CVS or Web access.
	* configure.in, include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, src/freeglut_internal.h,
	  src/freeglut_window.c: Completed removal of all support for the
	  offscreen rendering.
	  
	  If you wish to do offscreen supportin a portable manner, you will no
	  longer be able to do so with current versions of freeglut.
	* progs/demos/Makefile.am: Removed Makefile support for the offscreen
	  demo.
	* progs/demos/One/one.c, progs/demos/offscreen: Removed offscreen demo
	  program.

	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_misc.c, src/freeglut_state.c, src/freeglut_structure.c:
	  Resolution of X11 key-repeat handling
	  
	  glutSetKeyRepeat is global to all FreeGLUT windows in the application
	  glutIgnoreKeyRepeat is a per-window over-ride
	  
	  To avoid nasty global X11 state interaction, or GLUT-style event queue
	  filtering - the approach in FreeGLUT is to use the current key state
	  XQueryKeymap to detect and ignore KeyRelease/KeyPress pairs that are
	  auto-generated.

	* src/freeglut_window.c: Resolve [ 853044 ] FreeGLUT menus on Win32 in
	  task bar and ALT-TAB list CreateWindowEx(WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW,...)
	  extended style suppresses the popup menu window from the taskbar or
	  ALT-TAB list

2004-03-08  nigels

	* src/freeglut_init.c: ignoreKeyRepeat mode in FreeGLUT is TRUE by
	  default For compatibility with GLUT, the mode should be FALSE by
	  default This issues was probably undetected until now because
	  ignoreKeyRepeat didn't yet work.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Resolved bug #869765 glutIgnoreKeyRepeat() Fix

	  allows some additional flexibility with file layout. It should be the
	  responsibility of the build environment, rather than at source level.
	  This change tested on MSVC 6, cygwin and mingw32 gcc and Linux gcc.

	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: According to John F. Fay: The variable
	  "num_axes" should be "joy->num_axes".

2004-02-20  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_gamemode.c: Removed nonstandard #warning constructs.
	  Converted to XXX comments. (These are warnings about gamemode features
	  not working the same on some systems as on others. The semantics of
	  gamemode are dubious, since it was never formally documented, and has
	  for a long time worked in different ways on different systems, so it
	  is arguable that there is nothing really wrong with systems that don't
	  support resolution-changes.)
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: Fixed the bug where glutDisplayFunc() was
	  effectively invoking glutPostRedsiplay(). This is wrong on the face of
	  it, and may be at root for some of the annoying "timing" issues we've
	  had with redisplay events being called inappropriately.

2004-02-19  rkrolib

	* progs/demos/offscreen/Makefile.am: I had rubbed the
	  offscreen/Makefile.am off from the shapes demo. I forgot to remove a
	  couple of references to the shapes.c and shapes.dsp (.dsw?) files.
	* configure.in, include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, progs/demos/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/offscreen, progs/demos/offscreen/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/offscreen/offscreen.c: Added "offscreen" demo, a very
	  simple program that produces an onscreen window and, upon command,
	  renders a similar offscreen display and writes the result to disk.
	  
	  Also, modified the build structure for UNIX_X11 to autobuild the demo.
	  (Not done for WIN32 at this time.)
	  
	  Also, forgot to previously commit the updated freeglut_ext.h include.
	  Eeep.

	* src/freeglut_window.c: Minor comment adjustments.

2004-02-18  nigels

	* src/freeglut_geometry.c: Refinements to comments

2004-02-14  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Normalized the style of the new joystick a
	  bit.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: For some reason, the X "expose" event handler was
	  *directly* calling the display handler in the client. (Okay, it was
	  calling a function that operates on the window handle.)
	  
	  If you have any complexity to the display code, this can be painful to
	  watch. I can't think of a good reason to do the display immediately,
	  so I fixed the code to do a glutPostRedisplay().
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: A commit on behalf of John (in turn, and in
	  part, also on behalf of Thierry).
	  
	  * Renamed some of the old PLIB functions to have glut* prefixes. (I
	  guess that there is some thought about exporting them to the API.)
	  
	  * Changes from Thierry for FreeBSD support, and/or results of testing?
	  
	  * I re-merged an XXX comment re. NetBSD/amd64 and propogated a comment
	  on a duplicated #define for FreeBSD. We need the GNU autoconfig stuff
	  to be updated by someone who groks it, now.

2004-02-09  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_init.c: Commit of John's tidying-up of a comment, closing

2004-02-07  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_window.c: ...AND a tab snuck into my changes for
	  GLUT_OFFSCREEN support. Mea culpa.
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Removed a ^M that snuck into the #pragma for
	  the new joystick code.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Ooops. We don't want people to be able to
	  create a subwindow of an offscreen window. (^& This is no longer
	  permitted.
	  
	  (Actually, it would be nice if it would work, but I don't think that
	  you can subwindow a pixmap in UNIX_X11, and assume that subwindowing
	  offscreen doesn't work on WIN32, either.)
	* ChangeLog: Added entries for the joystick updates and the offscreen
	  experimental support.
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Changed a couple of XXX comments. Added a new
	  one. These all the nest of #ifs in the BSD section of the new joystick
	  code.
	* progs/demos/CallbackMaker/CallbackMaker.c: "Heavy editing" by John to
	  his CallbackMaker demo.
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: John added a #pragma to the joystick code for
	  WIN32 users.
	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_window.c: Adds GLUT_OFFSCREEN as
	  a display mode option. This includes:
	  
	  * Recognizing the mode when you call glutCreateWindow(). (Offscreen
	  looks and acts like a top-level window in many ways.)
	  
	  * During the life of the offscreen "window", various window-management
	  functions are modified to respect offscreen status.
	  
	  (Excepting reshaping windows, there is not much useful interpretation
	  for management of offscreen areas. Reshaping is possibly more work than
	  it's worth to support, and GLUT specs allow us to ignore the request.)
	  
	  * Cleanup for "offscreen" windows is a little different than for
	  regular windows.
	  
	  Windows still don't start up quite ideally. Offscreen windows should
	  probably get a reshape event, but not a display.

2004-02-05  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_joystick.c: Big import of updated
	  joystick code from PLIB, with permission from Steve Baker. Most of the
	  adaptation done by John, with a little bit of testing and changes by
	  Thierry Thomas and myself. Seems to compile on:
	  
	  WIN32 Red Hat LINUX FreeBSD NetBSD/amd64

2004-02-01  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Close a bug whereby events can be delayed
	  arbitrarily long if they get caught between the socket and the
	  client-side queue on X, sometime after glutMainLoopEvent()'s loop
	  quits and before the sleep code is invoked.

2004-01-16  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Amended a comment on fgCheckJoystickCallback().
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Minor style normalizations to minimize the diffs
	  between *now* and from before John's changes. No functional changes:
	  
	  * Removed some hard TABs introduced. * Removed some
	  spaces-at-end-of-line introduced. * A couple of function calls were
	  touched up.
	  
	  I did this separately only because I don't like messing with other
	  people's commits. (I don't like feeling like the style police, either,
	  but when I mess with the commit, there's no room for reverting my
	  interference if it is deemed undesirable...)
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Some changes from John.
	  
	  The main attraction seems to be correcting a bug with the action-on-
	  window-close.

2004-01-05  nigels

	* src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_window.c: Win32 glutIconifyWindow()
	  patch contributed by John F. Fay Restrict resize callbacks to visible
	  windows When iconified via glutIconifyWindow(), don't pass (0,0) to
	  resize callback Note that minimising the window via the menu or
	  minimise button is not yet resolved.

2003-12-30  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_menu.c, src/freeglut_structure.c:
	  Split a few overlong lines.
	  
	  Adjusted some spacing in a few spots to be more consistent with
	  freeglut style. Including one unindented if() body.
	  
	  Eliminated a dead variable.
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Changed several #ifdef's to proper #if's.
	  Eeek. Oook.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Hm... I thought that I committed this last night.
	  What's up?
	  
	  This is Nigel's modified fgSleepForEvents(), essentially. Take 2.

2003-12-30  nigels

	* include/GL/freeglut_std.h: Three supported win32 compilation
	  environments: MSVC, Cygwin and MingW32 #pragma is specific to MS
	  compiler
	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Explicitly cast function pointer to (void *)
	  in SET_WCB since all callbacks stored as void pointers suppress gcc

	* src/freeglut_structure.c: Typesafe handling of temporary window
	  destroy callback Move assignment out of while test, scope temporary

	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Three supported win32 compilation
	  environments: MSVC, Cygwin and MingW32 The windows mmsystem header

	* src/freeglut_font.c: strlen expects (char *), rather than (unsigned

	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Replace assignment of array to struct with

	  (unsigned char *) rather than (char *) suppress gcc in -Wall
	  -pendantic "noise"
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Replace #ifdef WIN32 with #ifdef
	  TARGET_HOST_WIN32, as per FreeGLUT convention
	* src/freeglut_init.c: fgState.FPSInterval is unsigned int (GLuint),
	  environment variable GLUT_FPS can be negative
	* src/freeglut_window.c: OpenGL context is not made current on Win32
	  until fgSetWindow is called. This resolves severe problems observed in
	  GLUI applications.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: #pragma message is only understood my MS
	  compiler #if defined(_MSC_VER) .. #endif
	* src/freeglut_state.c: Resolve bug 864978 - GLUT_OWNS_JOYSTICK

2003-12-25  rkrolib

	* progs/demos/CallbackMaker/CallbackMaker.c,
	  progs/demos/Fractals/fractals.c,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: Configuring with
	  "--enable-warnings" broke three demos: * CallbackMaker defined, but
	  did not use, the Joystick() function (a callback for the freeglut
	  joystick interface). I uncommented the callback-registration. I assume
	  that it was commented out because it was spammy. (freeglut does
	  joysticks by polling with a timer.) Perhaps a longer interval than
	  10ms would be advisable?
	  
	  * fractals.c used strcpy() without getting the prototype. Added
	  #include <string.h> at the top.
	  
	  * fractals_random.c had the same problem as fractals.c.

2003-12-23  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Moved the window-resize code so that it happens
	  whenever there is a pending resize for the window, whether or not the
	  window is visible or in need of a redisplay. The resize is now done
	  before the visibility and need-to-redisplay checks.

2003-12-22  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_structure.c: Got rid of those int/ptr warnings on AMD64.
	  (The code was casting an {int} to a pointer, and later retrieving the
	  int by another cast. It should be safe provided that pointers are at
	  least as big as {int}, but GCC was giving warnings on my system,
	  so...fixed.)
	* src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_structure.c: Several
	  test-on-assignment cases have been converted to stop GCC from
	  complaining about if( a = get_a_value_for_a( ) ) type code.

2003-12-19  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Ooops, left some cruft in a comment in the
	  header when committing the last patch. Cleaned up.
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c, src/freeglut_internal.h,
	  src/freeglut_structure.c: Wrote SET_WCB() to set a window callback.
	  This lets us out of using the FETCH_WCB() as an lvalue (which it
	  shouldn't, since the value of the FETCH is cast to the correct
	  function-pointer type).

2003-12-15  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* progs/demos/Fractals/Fractals.dsp: Change the destination directory of
	  the debug version to "Debug" (John Fay)

2003-12-13  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog: Release 2.2.0

2003-12-11  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_window.c: Stripped out TABs that got
	  reintroduced.
	  
	  There were no changes other than replacing about 10 to 12 TABs with a
	  visually-suitable number of spaces, so this can probably be blindly
	  treated as equivalent to the previous versions of the two affected
	  files.

2003-12-11  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_structure.c: The deferred window
	  destruction code was destroying the windows in reverse order. This
	  cased a crash when the call to glutDestroyWindow() for a sub windows
	  was immediately followed by a call to glutDestroyWindow() for it's
	  parent. fgCloseWindows() would call fgDestroyWindow() for the parent
	  first fgDestroyWindws() would recurse over the children and then
	  fgCloseWindows() would call fgDestroyWindow() again for the child.
	  
	  I've replaced the single linked list with one of our two way link list
	  structures. I've also moved it into fgStructure because that seemed
	  the consistent thing to do.
	  
	  I said the the deferred windows destruction causes more problems then
	  it solves.

2003-12-11  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* progs/demos/CallbackMaker/Makefile.am: Include project file in the

	* progs/demos/demos.dsw: Add shapes to the Visual C workspace.
	* progs/demos/shapes/Makefile.am: Package the visual C project file with

	* configure.in: Set the version to 2.2.0
	* src/freeglut_gamemode.c, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_window.c:

	* progs/demos/One/one.c: Disable/enable lighting in the "one.c" demo

	* progs/demos/CallbackMaker/CallbackMaker.dsp: Add some essentials to
	  get this program to compile (Nigel)
	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Update to reflect 2.2.0 release
	* ChangeLog: Note the release of 2.2.0 RC1

2003-12-11  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_structure.c, src/freeglut_window.c: John correctly
	  observed that the initialization {OldHeight} and {OldWidth} in the
	  window structure should be done for both windows and sub-windows, and
	  the easiest way to do this is in the
	  freeglut_structure.c:fgCreateWindow() code. So, transplant one line.

2003-12-10  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Commit of John's change to stop an infinite-loop
	  condition when the only windows left are freeglut menu windows, and
	  correctly calls exit() if we drop out of the main loop without having
	  requested any freeglut extensions to glutMainLoop() handling.

2003-12-07  rkrolib

	* progs/demos/shapes/shapes.c, progs/demos/shapes/shapes.dsp: Two from
	  Nigel:
	  
	  * Updated shapes.c. I think that it's just reformatting and the
	  addition of some comments.
	  
	  * Added shapes.dsp, a Microsoft Visual C++ Developer Studio Project
	  file for building shapes on WIN32 with MSVC++.

2003-12-03  Christopher John Purnell

	* configure.in: Added an option to enable gcc compiler warnings. I've
	  explicitly excluded the one about adding parentheses.

2003-12-03  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Touched up several comments, pointing up things
	  that may be worth reflect- ing upon in the future.
	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_window.c:
	  Hrm. I misunderstood the purpose of {window->State.Width} and
	  {...Height}. Those are *not* records of the old values, but rather of
	  the *desired* *new* values, hence it was inappropriate to use them in
	  ConfigureNotify X11 event handling. Doing so introduced some new
	  problems.
	  
	  So, I created OldHeight and OldWidth in the window State structure,
	  and *those* do what I require.
	  
	  I also stripped out the obsolete comment about getting extra/bogus
	  reshape events. (Though I maintain that an application should be
	  robust against them, freeglut should no longer generate them if the
	  window has not changed size since last reported.)

2003-12-02  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Changed Create/ConfigureNotify handling in
	  UNIX_X11:
	  
	  * Just need to call GETWINDOW() once. Ooops. Heh. * Update
	  {window->State} with the new size of the window. * If the window-size
	  has NOT changed, then do NOT call the Reshape event.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Added an "XXX" earmark for post-release
	  contemplation. (The point is definitely in need of consideration, I
	  believe, but is not immediately a major bug, so I'd rather not mess
	  with it at the risk of postponing a release "soon".)
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Ensure that the time-out for sleeping is never
	  negative.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Fixed a bug for UNIX_X11 where window reshape
	  events were causing freeglut to mark the window as *needing* a reshape
	  (which during general display callback handling would result in
	  effectively a glutReshapeWindow()).
	  
	  The code is now system-dependent. It should be abstracted to a
	  function, but is presently copied in two places. Sorry.
	  
	  Also, inverted the order of the associated if()/else check (in both
	  WIN32 and UNIX_X11 branches) since the former "else" part was a
	  one-line callback invocation.
	  
	  This fixes two seemingly unrelated bugs that I was seeing in UNIX_X11.

2003-12-01  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Added missing prototype for new list
	  function.

2003-11-28  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_structure.c: Timer optimizations. Made the list of
	  pendinig timers ordered. Added a free list of used timer structures.
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: Timer optimizations.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Fixed windows compilation problem with last
	  update.

2003-11-27  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_gamemode.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_structure.c, src/freeglut_window.c: Window close fix. The
	  default behaiour should now be the same as with glut.

2003-11-26  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_init.c: Added change from Nigel to have resize events
	  cause redraw events in WIN32. Also slightly reshuffled comments to
	  deal with line-wrap issues.

2003-11-25  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: John reported, and fixed, a problem that recent
	  changes caused for the Lorenz demo (seems to be WIN32 specific).
	* src/freeglut_structure.c: Update from John: Removed the freeglut hack
	  of decrementing the highst-window-ID marker when the highest window is
	  deleted. (This was a half-way measure for an idea that was decided to
	  be dubious in the first place.)
	* configure.in, progs/demos/Makefile.am, progs/demos/shapes,
	  progs/demos/shapes/Makefile.am, progs/demos/shapes/shapes.c: Added a
	  new demo (from Nigel) showing some of the basic GLUT geometry shapes.
	  "shapes" is the name of the demo.
	* include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, src/freeglut_geometry.c: Commit of work
	  from Nigel:
	  
	  Massive rework of the geometric primitive code. Includes a new
	  primitive (cylinder; solid and wireframe) and corresponding update to
	  freeglut_ext.h for the prototype.
	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_structure.c: More work from John (sorry for
	  procrastinating):
	  
	  * We forgot to bump our version number in freeglut_internal.h It is
	  now at 2.0.2 (actually, I think that 2.1.0 might be a better choice),
	  which is presumably going to be our next formal release. 2.0.1 is
	  incorrectly identified as 2.0.0 in the header.
	  
	  * A typo in a comment has been corrected ("than"/"that").
	  
	  * Numerous "manual" checks for callbacks are omitted now, since
	  INVOKE_WCB() does this for us. These were holdovers from the
	  pre-INVOKE_WCB() days. There may be some very subtle changes in
	  freeglut behavior, since freeglut used to test the callbacks a little
	  earlier in some cases and may have skipped some minor things (like
	  changes to the current window) in some special cases, otherwise. It is
	  not believed that any documented behavior is broken, and it is
	  unlikely---not to say impossible---that any extant applications will
	  detect the change. It is even possible that there is no external
	  behavioral change in freeglut.
	  
	  This also significantly simplifies some sections of code that used to
	  have conditional execution. "Unconditional code is simpler code" as
	  one of the comments used to say.
	  
	  * Lots of XXX commentary is now removed. Some of it was obsoleted by
	  other changes, some by changes from John.
	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_structure.c: Change from John (I removed a couple of
	  spaces from a couple of lines in his freeglut_internal.h file where
	  they were wrapping in EMACS; otherwise, the files are exactly as he
	  sent them to me).
	  
	  The change unifies the WIN32 and UNIX_X11 code by defining our own
	  window-handle-type in freeglut_internal.h. This let John rip out some
	  #if garbage in several places. The result is clearer code.
	  
	  Thanks, John!

	  lines into multiple lines. (Mostly things of the form: "if( condition

	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_window.c:
	  All changes are from John, except for: (a) I re-inserted the meat of a
	  comment that I still feel is relavent. (b) I fixed a compile-time
	  error in the UNIX_X11 code where a variable is declared after
	  executable code in a block without creating a new sub-block for the
	  declaration.
	  
	  Changes from John include: (a) Style revision. (b) Changes to postpone
	  the handling of window resizes.
	  
	  Lots of lines were changed, but I think that thos two cover the ground
	  that he hit. See the diffs for details.

2003-11-18  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_cursor.c, src/freeglut_ext.c, src/freeglut_geometry.c,
	  src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_menu.c, src/freeglut_state.c, src/freeglut_structure.c:
	  Lots of stuff that John F. Fay pointed out. Plus some changes to

2003-11-17  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_state.c, src/freeglut_structure.c: Fix spelling mistake
	  in a variable name. Added a comment for John Fay. Added the copyright
	  notice for XParseGeometry source.

2003-11-16  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_state.c, src/freeglut_structure.c: Made Modifers variable
	  global as per glut classic.
	* src/freeglut_init.c: Removed old unused glutInitDisplayString code.
	  Reformated new glutInitDisplayString and XParseGeometry code.
	* src/freeglut_init.c: Use XParseGeometry for better geometry parsing.
	  Moved geometry parsing to after fgInitialize() so we can use the
	  screen size to correctly calculate negative positions in the geometry
	  string. Copied the code for XParseGeometry from the X11 sources for
	  use in the Win32 version. freeglut now passes test1 of the glut test
	  suite.

2003-11-15  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_gamemode.c, src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h,
	  src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_structure.c, src/freeglut_window.c:
	  Removed the state variable BuildingAMenu. Instead pass a new parameter
	  isMenu to fgCreateWindow(). Elsewhere use window->IsMenu.
	* src/freeglut_init.c: freeglut_assert_ready is going to have to go at
	  some point. But for now I've moved setting fgState.Initalized to
	  GL_FALSE.
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c, src/freeglut_display.c,
	  src/freeglut_gamemode.c, src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h,
	  src/freeglut_joystick.c, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_menu.c,
	  src/freeglut_misc.c, src/freeglut_state.c, src/freeglut_structure.c,
	  src/freeglut_window.c: Replace TRUE with GL_TRUE and FALSE with
	  GL_FALSE where the type is GLboolean.

2003-11-15  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_menu.c: Normalized the spacing
	  around symbols, for the most part. Ho-hum.

2003-11-15  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Added a call to fgDeinitialize() before the call
	  to exit() in fgError().

2003-11-15  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Style normalizations to the joystick code.

2003-11-15  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_state.c, src/freeglut_structure.c, src/freeglut_window.c:
	  Added a new state variable "Initalized". Replaced referenced to
	  Time.Set with this new variable where appropriate. fgElapsedTime() now
	  set the start time if Time.Set is false. Moved
	  glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) handling to before the assert.

2003-11-14  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Normalized the internal header's style a bit.
	* src/freeglut_init.c: Plowed one more file this morning. Still just
	  trivial formatting issues.
	  
	  And I left alone the "INIT DISPLAY STRING PARSING" section, since it
	  still appears to be in flux.
	* src/freeglut_font.c, src/freeglut_gamemode.c: Yet more trivial style
	  normalizations.
	  
	  Sorry, but that's all that I'm up to at the moment. On the plus,
	  excepting the font_data file (which I've been skipping), up through
	  this file, I think that the code style is pretty close to uniform.
	* src/freeglut_font.c: Minor style corrections.
	* src/freeglut_display.c: Minor spacing quibble.
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Added a brief explanatory note to the X code
	  for GLUT_CURSOR_NONE.
	  
	  Corrected the indentation of a block of code.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Noted one of a few cases where we do something
	  immediately that could more efficiently be postponed, quite
	  easily---and which GLUT promises *is* to be postponed. (It is unlikely
	  that the difference will break any apps, but postponing should be
	  easy...)
	  
	  No real change, just a comment in the code.

2003-11-11  rkrolib

	* ChangeLog: Updated ChangeLog for the day.
	* include/GL/freeglut_std.h, progs/demos/One/one.c, src/freeglut_ext.c,
	  src/freeglut_font.c: Removal of all remaining TABs in the freeglut
	  *.[ch] files. (I missed a few in the "one" demo, it seems, and some
	  more crept back into freeglut_(ext|font).c, presumably due to my own
	  edits when I forgot to use the "freeglut-c-mode" in EMACS.)
	* progs/demos/One/one.c: Moved glutInit*() functions ahead of
	  glutInit(). (This is proper use of glutInit() in general, since it
	  allows the user to override settings via {argc, argv} command-line
	  params.)
	* progs/demos/One/one.c: Style normalizations: Removed CRs and hard TABs
	  mostly.
	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_structure.c: Corrected the numbering of the
	  ChangeLog (there were two (110)s).
	  
	  Added entries summarizing my commits since September or late August,
	  for the benefit of those lacking both CVS and web access.
	* progs/demos/demos.dsw: Added CRs to the ends of all lines in MS
	  developer studio demos.dsw file..

2003-11-10  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: John's fix for the minimize/close/maximize
	  controls no longer working. WIN32 expected us to pass the message on
	  up the chain (or do something else with it), rather than just throwing
	  away the event, for a certain class of events. (See the diffs for more
	  details.)
	  
	  The code is also slightly reformatted from what was previously in the
	  repository.
	* freeglut.dsp, freeglut_static.dsp,
	  progs/demos/CallbackMaker/CallbackMaker.dsp, progs/demos/demos.dsw: A
	  *.dsp file for CallbackMaker in the demos.
	  
	  Plus updated *.dsp and *.dsw files to reflect the new freeglut header
	  file.
	  
	  NOTE: The prior version of the *.dsw file does not in fact have CRs. I
	  thought that it did. For consistency, I am not putting them in in this
	  version, either. (At least one person said that his MSVC++ system is
	  happy with the current files. If there are problems, we can easily add
	  the CRs, but that should be a separate commit...)
	* configure.in, progs/demos/CallbackMaker,
	  progs/demos/CallbackMaker/CallbackMaker.c,
	  progs/demos/CallbackMaker/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c,
	  progs/demos/Makefile.am: New demo from John: CallbackMaker.
	  
	  This demo shows the use of every callback that you can register with
	  freeglut, and also generates event reports so that you can see what is
	  happening to the program as it runs.
	  
	  Not much to look at, but both utilitarian and a practical example.
	  
	  Please double-check that I updated everything that needs to be
	  updated. I reran autogen.sh and ./configure, and it built okay for me.
	  (^&
	* src/freeglut_structure.c: Hm. I thought that I already hit this file
	  for style normalization. Oh well... Should be no functional changes.
	  Should be pretty close to in-line with the style of changes that I've
	  been making else- where.
	* src/freeglut_structure.c: Ooops. Forgot that we already had a call to
	  fgClearCallBacks() in the code and added a second one. I just deleted
	  the new one. Sorry.
	* src/freeglut_structure.c: Added Nigel's suggested code to clear all
	  but the destroy callback early on, leaving Destroy to be cleared later
	  after the last possible point where it should be invoked.
	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Modified the menus to refer to {border} rather
	  than {FREEGLUT_MENU_BORDER}, in fghDisplayMenuBox(). The local
	  variable was already defined and used for some purposes, so we might
	  as well use it throughout. It does serve to shorten and clarify the
	  code a bit---though I have mixed feelings about creating aliases that
	  way.
	  
	  Still, the variable already existed and was already used in places.
	  (We could even move it into the freeglut state, or make it a {const
	  static} value...)
	  
	  Oh well. Stuff to ponder.
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Well, a couple of days have gone by, so I
	  assume that items (a) and (b) in the freeglut_cursor.c file's "Open
	  issues" comment are now satisfactor- ily closed.
	  
	  I also partially implemented some error-checking, using my limited
	  understanding of how Xlib users are supposed to do this. (No one
	  commented about the lack of error-checking, pro or con. Perhaps
	  someone will care to comment now?)
	  
	  At present, it just will print out a warning, via fgWarning(). In part
	  because I'm not sure what is best to do, and in part because failure
	  to set the cursor type is probably not a fatal problem.

2003-11-08  Christopher John Purnell

	* progs/demos/Fractals/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Lorenz/Makefile.am, progs/demos/One/Makefile.am: Applied
	  Braden McDaniel's non-srcdir build patch.

2003-11-08  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_menu.c: A first pass over freeglut_menu.c to bring it in
	  line with the rest of freeglut's style. Mostly re-indenting and
	  splitting long lines. For those that may be concerned: No, I didn't do
	  any more arrangements of the form (CONST == a) rather than (a ==
	  CONST). (^&
	* progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: Altered the way that
	  the {random} value (from 0..3) is chosen.
	  
	  Previously, it picked out two adjacent bits in the result of rand().
	  Unfortunately, these adjacent bits (at least on NetBSD) have a certain
	  amount of dependence. After a period (perhaps a thousand or so?), it
	  starts to repeat the pattern of those two bits. (I think; I haven't
	  actually tested that directly.) This presumably is locking it into a
	  an an N-way attractor on the "snowflake", such that if you zoom in a
	  ways, you will start to see some spots *quickly* are colored, and
	  others are *never* colored.
	  
	  What I've done now is to pick up two widely-spaced bits in a single
	  rand() call. (Perhaps we would do as well to pick up something like
	  bit #16 from two consecutive rand() calls?) These widely-spaced bits
	  have a lower statistical dependence on one another (if I can get away
	  with using that term for an arithmetic operation; though since stats
	  has more to do with sampling and less to do with true randomness, I
	  may be safe).
	  
	  The net effect, at leats on NetBSD, is far better snowflake if you
	  zoom in on it.

2003-11-07  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: From John:
	  
	  [This] implements the visible/invisible for Windows. It does NOT call
	  the visibility callback, though.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Stripped out the now truly extraneous {braces} in
	  such forms as:
	  
	  if( ... ) { INVOKE_WCB( ... ); }
	  
	  Check for compiling on WIN32.
	* src/freeglut_internal.h: Adopted Eero Pajarre's suggestion of using a
	  do { ... } while rather than { ... } for the INVOKE_WCB() macro. This
	  lets it be used "more like a function", in that:
	  
	  if( ... ) INVOKE_WCB( ... ); else ...
	  
	  ...is now legal.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Pure code janitoring: Shuffled the order of some
	  of the case statements in the UNIX_X11 X event processing loop. (In
	  general, it's nice to have case statements sorted, especially when you
	  have a *huge* switch statement like this. That makes it easier to find
	  the one that you're looking for, and to see if a certain case is
	  defined...)
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Combined EnterNotify and LeaveNotify event
	  processing in the UNIX_X11 event loop.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Added ReparentNotify case to UNIX_X11 event loop,
	  to catch the extraneous ReparentNotify event types (type 21).
	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_structure.c: Oh well, I might as
	  well add the call to clear callbacks on window destruction. Also
	  renamed the function to do this: fgClearCallBacks(). Ho-hum.
	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_structure.c: Added
	  fgInitCallBacks() to freeglut_structure.c. (The function takes an
	  {SFG_Window *}.) Added prototype to freeglut_internal.h. Added use of
	  the function to the window initialization. (Don't count on calloc(),
	  which sets all bits to 0.)
	* src/freeglut_gamemode.c: Style normalization; removal of
	  say-nothing-useful comments.
	* src/freeglut_font.c: Normalized the style of freeglut_font.c No
	  substantial alterations.
	* src/freeglut_ext.c: Somewhat normalized the style of this file.
	  
	  Also moved the "glutMouseWheelFunc" extension down into the
	  "extensions" part of the table. (Purely internal organization. It will
	  still be found.)
	* src/freeglut_display.c: Further normalization of the code's style. No
	  substantial changes.
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Split one last overlong line in
	  freeglut_cursor.c.
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Added GLUT_CURSOR_NONE support in UNIX_X11
	  (well, NetBSD; you lot need to try it on others; (^&).
	  
	  Deallocated some resources that we are creating. VERY slight memory
	  leak, but plugged now.
	  
	  These two complete the first two "Open issues" ( (a) and (b) ). The
	  first one also completes X support for glutSetCursor(). If others can
	  verify, we can fully demote the outstanding bug over this to
	  WIN32-specific.
	  
	  I'll delete the dead Open issues and re-letter the others if someone
	  will cross-check me. Or if no one says anything in a day or two. (^&
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Further normalized the style of the cursor
	  code.
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: Slight style improvements. Two rules of
	  thumb that are almost always good to apply:
	  
	  * Don't write a == CONST. Instead, write CONST == a. Or, more
	  generally (in C like languages): Avoid putting an lvalue on the
	  left-hand side of an == comparison. (For consistency, I try to avoid
	  lvalues on the left- hand side of any comparison---but == is the most
	  notorious.)
	  
	  (An "lvalue" is a value that can safely go on the left side of an "="
	  assignment, of course. (^&)
	  
	  * Do not write if( !condition ) return; other_thing; return;
	  
	  (See page 18 of K&P's _The Elements of Programming Style_.)
	  
	  Instead, it is better to just write:
	  
	  if( condition ) other_thing; return;
	  
	  There are times when sacrificing structured programming (e.g., via
	  multiple return statements) is okay. But, here, there is no apparent
	  gain---indeed, there seems only loss---in the non-structured code.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Grr. Forgot to enable the "freeglut" C
	  programming mode in EMACS, and had a few TABs in the last commit. This
	  fixes that. Sorry.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Minor corrections to the UNIX_X11 mouse-wheel
	  support. In part this reflects that {button} is already shifted to the
	  GLUT numbering, and hence should be counted as 3&4, 5&6, etc.
	  
	  The other change was simply to clarify the computation of {direction}.
	  The original code did some clever arithmetic. The new code is more
	  straightforward, even if it requires more lines to express.

2003-11-06  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Ooops. I screwed up on part of John's fixes.
	  Sorry.
	  
	  I think that I have his fix properly committed now. Mea culpa.
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c, src/freeglut_internal.h,
	  src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_structure.c: Cleanup pass after
	  committing callback conversion (from structure to array-of-pointers).
	  Mostly deleted commented-out struct-based code. Also added some XXX
	  comments that I though should be pondered. (My own pair of eyes, and
	  one brain cell, were not sufficient at this time to decide what to do
	  for those ponderables. (^&)
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c, src/freeglut_init.c,
	  src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_joystick.c, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_misc.c, src/freeglut_structure.c: Converted the
	  "Callbacks" structure (with named members holding individual callback
	  pointers) to a "CallBacks" array in fgState. (This is to allow us to
	  write a loop to clear all callbacks from windows when the window is
	  dead/dying. Using this, we can safely assign NULL to each in a loop.)
	  
	  Support includes two new macros, FETCH_WCB() and INVOKE_WCB(). See
	  freeglut_internal.h for more details there.
	  
	  Some typedefs of function pointer types were altered to make them more
	  uniform (necessary for the macros).
	  
	  All references to window-based callbacks in freeglut are updated to
	  use the new macros.
	  
	  Old usages will cause compile-time errors.
	  
	  As a side bonus, the new invocation macro sets the current window and
	  checks pointers so that these common steps can be uniformly done on
	  every window-based callback. This makes it easier to do things right.
	  At the same time, the array notation (and now required associated
	  casts) make it harder to bypass the macros and abuse the function
	  pointers, in general.
	  
	  After this commit, I will go through the code and clean up dangling
	  issues about formatting. This commit is just a "it now works, let's
	  checkpoint it" type of affair.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: From John, a couple of lines needed to be changed
	  to fix the mouse wheel support on WIN32.
	* progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: Update from John:
	  Includes mouse button, mouse motion, and mouse wheel support.

2003-11-04  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Multiple changes from John. Style issues, plus a
	  bug-fix to check a pointer before deallocating some memory.
	  
	  He also removed one obsolete comment, and added some more comments.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Some changes, mostly from John. Mostly style
	  changes.
	  
	  One bug fix from John: Execution state bug-fix in glutMainLoop(), per
	  his post yesterday.
	  
	  One fix from me: Changed "if( ButtonPress )" to "if( pressed )".
	  {ButtonPress} is a constant.
	* progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: Per John's emailed
	  desire to have all files obey UNIX EOL conventions, I have stripped
	  out carriage returns from this file.
	  
	  This is the *only* change, but every line is touched. If you want to
	  see the real differences between older and newer versions, you will
	  have to get local copies of each and first match their EOL
	  convnetions.
	* progs/demos/Lorenz/lorenz.c: Update from John:
	  
	  I [John] added a feature to check for memory leaks under Windows.
	* progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: Update from John:
	  
	  I [John] converted everything to double precision to avoid compiler
	  warnings. I also added a feature to check for memory leaks under
	  Windows and removed a memory leak (surprise!).
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c, src/freeglut_cursor.c,
	  src/freeglut_display.c, src/freeglut_ext.c, src/freeglut_font.c,
	  src/freeglut_gamemode.c, src/freeglut_geometry.c,
	  src/freeglut_glutfont_definitions.c, src/freeglut_init.c,

	  src/freeglut_structure.c, src/freeglut_teapot.c,
	  src/freeglut_videoresize.c, src/freeglut_window.c: Got rid of the
	  G_LOG_DOMAIN junk, per discussion on the mailing list.
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: Minor formatting quibbles. (The brain isn't
	  up to anything more serious at the moment.)
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Missed a block where one level was 2-space
	  indented.
	  
	  Nit-picked a few other lines for consistency.

2003-11-03  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_init.c: Fixed a memory leak (thanks for the correction,
	  John!).
	  
	  Smoothed over some code style issues while I was here, but left the
	  init-string parsing alone for now.
	* freeglut13.dsp, freeglutdll.dsp, freeglutstatic.dsw: Deleted 3 files
	  (again?) from CVS, on John's request. Old/obsolete MSVC++ project
	  files. (freeglut13.dsp, freeglutdll.dsp, freeglutstatic.dsw)
	* src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_structure.c: * Indentation issues. *
	  Pulled some common code into a nicely packaged function. * Found some
	  pointer/int issues.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Heh.
	  
	  Forgot to wrap the fgGetXModifiers() in a #if. Fixed.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Extracted some common code to a subroutine, in
	  glutMainLoopEvent(). (The common code was a snippet to compute X
	  keyboard modifiers as a bit-mask of GLUT symbols.)
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Caught a few more little style issues.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Added a "case" for an X event that we turn on but
	  do not use. ({MapNotify}). We already caught {MappingNotify} and
	  {UnmapNotify}.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: * Fixed a bug in the X11 handling of
	  scrollwheel/mouse. The old code, I believe, checked if *either* a
	  wheel or button callback was set, and then decided which to use---and
	  unconditionally called it. I left the "either" check in, but added
	  additional checks before actually doing the invocation. * Lots of
	  reformatting. Massive. The usual suspects, though, and fairly trivial:
	  Re-indenting to standard size, shuffling some spaces to match the
	  freeglut "standard" of: if( ... ) ...and: func( ... )

2003-10-31  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: Cleaned up one macro definition.
	  
	  Picked up an over-long line that I missed before.
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: Fit some long lines to 80 columns.
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c, src/freeglut_display.c,
	  src/freeglut_gamemode.c, src/freeglut_geometry.c: Last of the hard
	  TABs in the src/*.c files.
	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_joystick.c, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_menu.c, src/freeglut_state.c: En masse removal of most (I
	  think) of the remaining hard TABs in files. There are still a couple
	  of files that need to be hit.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Picked up some stray TABs scattered in this
	  file.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Noted by XXX comments that the XFlush() calls
	  probably shouldn't be there. Flushing the X protocol stack every
	  little bit both adds clutter to the code and may impede performance.
	  
	  It seems that we should be able to get rid of these, though allowing
	  client code to directly call glutMainLoopEvent() does make it a little
	  more complicated.
	  
	  Something to ponder.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Polished off the say-nothing-new comments and
	  lines-over-80-columns in freeglut_window.c
	  
	  There should be no functional changes.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Missed a few say-nothing-new comments in
	  fgOpenWindow(). Eeep. Should be better now. (^&
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Cleansed fgCloseWindow(): * say-nothing-new
	  comments axed. * de-TABbed. * Made the white-space to be consistent.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Cleaned up fgOpenWindow(): * Removed TABs. *
	  Made indentation consistent. * Deleted say-nothing-new comments. *
	  Changed an *error*check* from an assert to an if(). (The error-check
	  was on window creation; we don't want to lose that if the user
	  compiles with asserts deactivated. Also, assert()s really tell us more
	  about programming errors, rather than run-time errors, so it is a
	  little misleading to use assert() for error-checks, even if you can
	  depend upon assert()s never being compiled away to null statements.) *
	  Added some XXX comments for things that bear some rumination.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Cleanup to fgSetWindow(). The usual suspects: *
	  Removed tabs. * Made indentation consistent. * Killed off
	  say-nothing-new comments.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Cleanup to fgSetupixelFormat(). Should be no
	  functional changes.
	  
	  Code facelift included:
	  
	  * Consistent indentation. * Removal of all TABs (there were a bunch).
	  * Fit to 80 columns.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: There should be no changes to code
	  functionality, though a fair bit of little changes to the code
	  appearance.
	  
	  * Fit the comments at the start of the file to fit 80 columns. * Noted
	  an unusual feature of the ATTRIB() macro. * Added ATTRIB_VAL() macro
	  which is really just two ATTRIB()s. This lets us put things like
	  {ATTRIB (GLX_RED_SIZE); ATTRIB (1);} on one statement: {ATTRIB_VAL
	  (GLX_RED_SIZE, 1);}. I did this to preserve some of the layout of
	  information while also avoiding the nasty semi-visible ";" in the
	  middle of a line of code. And by putting the {braces} in the macro
	  definition, I was able to visually clean code of the form: if
	  (condition) { ATTRIB( X ); ATTRIB( 1 ); } ...rewriting as: if
	  (condition) ATTRIB_VAL( X, 1 ); * Eliminated a bunch of
	  say-nothing-new comments in fgChooseVisual(). * Combined some
	  semi-useful comments into a block comment summarizing a loop.

2003-10-30  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_structure.c: Finished off most of the issues with
	  freeglut_structure.c, from a stylistic point of view (at least,
	  insofar as: The original file's code was INCON- SISTANT. I did not
	  remove the "!= NULL" stuff, did not address the shortest-branch-first
	  issue for if-else statements, and left some rather ugly "if (x) {...
	  return y} /* else do this */ return NULL;" garbage. This should, I
	  think, be re-written as "if (x) return y; else return NULL;" or even
	  better, "ret = NULL; if (x) ret = y; return ret;"
	  
	  In short, the code still has some issues, but I think that it's a bit
	  better.
	  
	  (Oh, I also got rid of outstanding TABs.)
	* src/freeglut_structure.c: Eliminated most of the say-nothing-new
	  comments.
	  
	  Fit most of the code to no more than 80 columns.
	  
	  Raised some issues about completeness/correctness of trying to
	  decrement the max-window-ID (apparently in order to partially recycle
	  some window IDs to slightly slow the rate of growth of window IDs). (I
	  didn't change what the code does, though.)
	  
	  The functionality of the code should be unchanged.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Forgot to set {direction} explicitly to +/- 1 for
	  freeglut mouse-wheel API on MS-WINDOWS. Oops.
	  
	  Now it should always report +/- 1 on MS-WINDOWS, per the spec.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Minor fix to allow for multiple ticks to be
	  received at one time by the WIN32 code. Take abs(direction) as the
	  number of ticks, and count it down.
	  
	  <stdlib.h> *should* be included by freeglut_internal.h, I think, so it
	  should be okay; otherwise add a suitable #include.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Grrr. My attempt to commit got aborted, and the
	  commit message was lost. Now I've lost track of what I said I'd done.
	  Something like:
	  
	  * Fixed some issues with multiple wheels. * Noted in comments some
	  issues about other-than-3-real-buttons. * Fixed formatting to fit 80
	  columns. * Removed some BCPL/C++ style comments (//) that are not
	  legal, and which, if memory servers, are not even strictly legal when
	  disabled by preprocessor directives. E.g.,
	  
	  #if 0 not-syntactically-valid-C #endif
	  
	  ...is not legal. Though most cpp's will discard the bracketed material
	  completely before the main C compiler pass has a chance to analyze the
	  syntax. (MSVC++ and GCC both don't seem to mind the BCPL style
	  comments in plain C, but let's keep the sources clean, eh?) * Fixed a
	  problem that would have caused freeglut to report doubled wheel events
	  under XFree86.
	  
	  Not tested other than compiling. Personally, I think that the
	  interface is inherently broken at this point unless you are willing to
	  get user- configuration. (Which would then solve the complaint that
	  Steve had about computing the tick-size on behalf of applications.)
	  I.e., there is NO WAY to know if we have the right buttons to start
	  wheels at, or if there are any buttons after the first wheel(s), etc.
	  We just have to guess---and if we are wrong, we can get varying
	  degrees of brokeness.

2003-10-29  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_window.c: There is a problem with the way I did
	  glutFullscreen() in my last commit. So I've copied the way the game
	  mode does it. It's not ideal but it works. The glutGet() for the
	  window border sizes will also have to be fixed at some point.
	* src/freeglut_window.c: Rewrote glutFullscreen(). It now correctly
	  places the window in X11. It now uses system dependent code for more
	  efficient use of windowing system calls.

2003-10-29  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Should be no real changes to the code
	  function.
	  
	  I missed a few lines that went past 80 columns. (^&
	  
	  Also made formatting more consistent.
	  
	  Added a couple of XXX comments re. FreeBSD vs. general BSD #ifdef's.
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Should be entirely superficial changes to
	  code style:
	  
	  * Fit lines to 80 columns. (It does get tiresome seeing long lines
	  forced to break by the right-hand border of windows...(^&) *
	  Eliminated say-nothing-new comments. * Made formatting more consistent
	  in spots. * Eliminated some hard TAB characters.
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Added Thierry's change to include
	  sys/param.h. This lets us pick out version numbers for OS releases
	  corresponding to system headers.
	  
	  I modified it to also work with NetBSD; I cannot confirm if it is safe
	  with any other systems, so it remains protected by a #if.
	* src/freeglut_state.c: Deleted some say-nothing-new comments.
	  
	  Added some XXX's where comments seemed to require future attention.
	  
	  Added some new comments with XXX's where future attention seems
	  profitable.
	* src/freeglut_state.c: Deleted a bunch of say-nothing-new comments.
	  Someday, there shall be an end to them.
	* src/freeglut_state.c: Previous changes were made without the freeglut
	  major mode in EMACS. Re-tweaked some lines (mostly got rid of some
	  TABs, but also resulted in some changed indentation).
	  
	  Reformatted a big comment to fit to 80 columns.
	  
	  Removed bogus references to "Linux". (UNIX, and/or X11 were relavent,
	  and "UNIX/X11" was substituted for "Linux" in those places. This
	  includes UNIX-alike systems.)
	* src/freeglut_state.c: Rewrote the TODO BEFORE THE STABLE RELEASE
	  comment to fit to 80 columns.
	  
	  Cleanup of fghGetConfig(). (One return statement, simpler code.)
	  
	  Made glutSetOption() have a more consistent style---and also got its
	  lines to stay under 80 columns.
	* src/freeglut_misc.c: Got the last of the say-nothing-new comments in
	  freeglut_misc.c.
	  
	  (I would have picked them up before, but wanted the bug-fix and
	  conversion-to-error-message changes to go in before I did more
	  superficial stuff.)
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_misc.c: *
	  Fixed a bug that I introduced in fgWarning()/fgError(): I thought that
	  ((a) || (b)) was defined to have value as: (a) if (a) != 0 (b) if (a)
	  == 0
	  
	  ...instead, it has value 0/1. This was causing a bug. It's probably
	  just as well, since what I was trying to do definitely fell into the
	  category of "clever code" rather than "clear code".
	  
	  Sorry.
	  
	  * Made glutSetKeyRepeat() call fgError() if you go out of range. (The
	  old code silently did nothing---not even a warning.)
	  
	  If it is really desirable to keep running, we should probably at least
	  generate an fgWarning().
	  
	  * Deleted some say-nothing-new comments.
	  
	  * XXX added: Is glutSetKeyRepeat() deprecated?

2003-10-28  rkrolib

	* include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, src/freeglut_callbacks.c,
	  src/freeglut_ext.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c:
	  Commit, mostly of work from John:
	  
	  * Removed some say-nothing-useful comments. * Added some tentative
	  mouse-wheel support. * Fairly massive reformatting of code.
	  
	  I made some secondary changes to his changes:
	  
	  * One compilation error was fixed (missing close-paren + semicolon). *
	  Deleted a few ore say-nothing-useful comments. * Some of John's code
	  was strangely formatted to the point that it seemed completely out of
	  place, so I took the liberty of reformatting it. Since I used GNU
	  EMACS's <tab> key (which re-indents rather than inserts TAB
	  characters), I had to propagate some indentation changes a little
	  further than the bare necessity to match up with John's changes. (John
	  seems to shoot for 2-space indents, while EMACS (and I, I confess)
	  strongly prefer 4-space indents. The code that I was re-indenting had
	  been put to 8-space indents, however.)
	  
	  I have *not* tested the code beyond compiling. I assume that John did
	  (and that the compilation error was a result a minor change just
	  before asking me to commit).
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Re-indentation style changes from John.
	  
	  There should be no alterations to how the code performs.
	  
	  (I modified how the X11 section of the set-cursor code is indented to
	  slightly better match (IMHO) the rest of his changes.)

2003-10-27  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Converted a few "x != NULL" tests to "x" for
	  clarity.
	  
	  I think that I've touched enough lines of source for one morning.
	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Cleaned up a little redundancy in a comment on
	  the {menu_pen_*} variables.
	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Removed about 90 lines of say-nothing-new
	  comments.
	  
	  The code should be functionally unaltered by these changes.
	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Propogated a pointer-check from menu-attach to
	  menu-detach. (Apparently, in some cases, the Menu member variable can
	  be NULL.)
	  
	  Corrected the menu-attach code to make sure that both Window and Menu
	  pointers are non-NULL (rather than "at least one").
	  
	  Rewrote button-checks to more simply and more clearly assert that the
	  "menu button" is a valid button for menu actions: Instead of
	  laboriously comparing against the three valid buttons (0, 1, 2 or
	  GLUT_BUTTON_*), we do a simpler range-check and the upper bound is
	  {FREEGLUT_MAX_MENUS}, allowing us to change the number of menuable
	  buttons fairly easily in the future.
	  
	  Also deleted a few say-nothing-new comments.
	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Cosmetic changes (mostly deleted a few more
	  say-nothing-new comments). The functionality of the code should be
	  unchanged.
	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Changed an "#elif TARGET_HOST_UNIX_X11" to
	  "#else", since this simply governed menu aesthetics. I think that it's
	  better to have a default that works than to break completely, should
	  freeglut ever be ported to a new (non-WIN32, non-UNIX/X11) target.
	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Minor modifications to the menus:
	  
	  * Updated an old "TODO BEFORE STABLE" comment.
	  
	  * Expanded a comment re. some #define macros.
	  
	  * Made colors and font choice system dependent. The UNIX freeglut
	  menus look more like UNIX GLUT menus, now. (This is PURELY a cosmetic
	  change. But it achieves better compatibility visually.)
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Cleaned up glutMainLoop() a bit:
	  
	  * Deleted numerous say-nothing-new comments. * Reformatted a
	  say-something-useful comment to fit on an 80-column display.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Partially (re-?)unified some of the
	  glutMainLoopEvent() code. The only code that really needs to be
	  system-specific is the window event handling, which in MS-WINDOWS is
	  tucked into a separate function. In UNIX/X11, it's all spilled out
	  into glutMainLoopEvent() for some reason.
	  
	  If the X11 code could be tucked into another function,
	  glutMainLoopEvent() could be platform-independent.

2003-10-26  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Moved the idle callback out of
	  glutMainLoopEvent() and into glutMainLoop(), per discussion on the
	  list. The code looks okay, to me, though I remain less than wholly
	  convinced that treating idles as special cases is the best way to go.
	  Still, a case can be made for taking "non-event" idle callbacks out of
	  the "event loop". From an organizational perspective, I think that
	  it's an improvement, and it fixes a bug for at least one program.
	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Added John's text-positioning modification.
	  
	  The lines that he was altering were very oddly-split, so while I was
	  at it, I repaired the line-break damage.
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Committed change from Nigel to fix the
	  joystick bug. (The joystick code was not setting the GLUT window prior
	  to calling callbacks.)
	  
	  Please verify. If so, this closes out, I think, the latter half of
	  that bug report, so anyone with the means to modify/close bug reports
	  should do so upon verification of the fix.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Superficial cleanup of the code. Mostly taking
	  lines such as:
	  
	  ...
	  
	  /* * <Enslish recapituation of the single following C statement> */
	  <single C statement>
	  
	  ...and rewrote as:
	  
	  ... <single C statement>
	  
	  freeglut_main.c still has a lot of that in it, but it looks a bit
	  better, now.
	* src/freeglut_init.c: Added some error-checking (particularly w.r.t.
	  strdup()).
	  
	  Deleted numerous 4-line "padding" sequences of C-as-English trans-
	  literation comments.
	  
	  Re-indented some (but not all) code that is using 2-space indentation.
	  (Most of the freeglut code seems to be using 4-space indentation.)
	  
	  I did not touch the "INIT DISPLAY STRING PARSING" code, since it is
	  filled with a ton of over-long lines and also appears to be in more
	  flux than the rest of the code. (Well, I added one error-check to a
	  strdup().)
	* src/freeglut_font.c: Removed two more bogus "carriage return"
	  references where the comments were in fact talking about a line feed
	  (a.k.a. newline, LF, ^J, \n, ...).
	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c:
	  Fixed the buglet about failing to report the program's name on error-
	  messages. Please test. (Modified glutInit(), the state structure, and
	  the warn/err functions.)

2003-10-23  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog: Released 2.0.1

2003-10-21  Christopher John Purnell

	* configure.in, include/GL/Makefile.am, include/GL/freeglut.h,
	  include/GL/freeglut_std.h, include/GL/glut.h,
	  progs/demos/Fractals/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Lorenz/Makefile.am, progs/demos/One/Makefile.am,
	  src/Makefile.am: Added --disable-replace-glut option to autoconf
	  configure.

2003-10-15  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS: Noted the release of 2.0.0
	* configure.in: Version bump

2003-10-14  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_font.c: Swept the freeglut_font.c for comment cleanup: *
	  Got rid of the "rewrite C as English" comments. * Corrected several
	  bogus references to "carriage returns" (in strings). The symbols were
	  newlines or EOLs or LFs (\n). They were *not* carriage returns or CRs
	  (\r). * Clarified the comments on glBitmap() calls.

2003-10-13  rkrolib

	* progs/demos/Fractals/fractals.c,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: Small bug-fix that's
	  been on my mind:
	  
	  Modified the two Fractals* demos so that they only clear (for the
	  random one) or redraw (for the non-random one) if there is need to do
	  so. (E.g., pressing the space bar should not clear and redraw the
	  random fractal since no parameters are altered.)
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c, src/freeglut_display.c: Removed the obsolete
	  hack (or very ill-conceived dream), fgDisplayCursor().
	* src/freeglut_display.c: Cleaned up some of the style issues (mostly
	  "fluff" comments) in freeglut_display.c.
	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Comment-cleaning sweep.
	  
	  Mostly got rid of the say-it-in-English comments that were adding 1
	  line of English and 2 or 3 lines of filler for each of several lines
	  of C code. Updated a couple of other comments, and tweaked some
	  white-space.
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: Cleaned up the comments a bit in the
	  callbacks.c file (mostly removed some of the
	  kill-4-lines-to-translate-one-line-of-C-into-English comments).

2003-10-12  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_cursor.c: Added all missing GLUT cursor types for X11.
	  
	  (Type NONE is not properly supported, yet.)
	  
	  Corrected behavior for the several old types: * Wrong glyphs. *
	  Reversed glyphs (left/right confusion!)
	  
	  There are some remaining imperfections, but it's a lot closer to GLUT
	  comformity, now.

2003-10-11  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: Three tidying-up changes to the code of
	  freeglut_callbacks.c; none of them are Earth-shattering, but as I
	  swept through looking somewhat more systematically for errors, I
	  picked these off. See the diff's for details.
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: Fixed a basic readability/style error in the
	  code. (Two statements per line are almost never a good idea; in this
	  case the combined line was past 80 columns.)
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: Added a safety-check on a memory allocation.
	  (Timers were using dynamic memory allocation but NOT checking the
	  result!)
	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Committed two lines from John to help fix the
	  menus a bit.
	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c: Check the glutDisplayFunc() callback for
	  being a NULL pointer. This is illegal and is disallowed in GLUT 3.0+,
	  so we disallow it too in freeglut 2.0.1+

2003-10-09  rkrolib

	* progs/demos/Fractals/fractals.c,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: Applied John's updated
	  ReadConfigFile() changes to the fractals demos.
	* progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: Fixed: * glutInit()
	  ordering w.r.t. glutInit*() and {argv} processing. * Aspect ratio. *
	  Removed depth-buffer usage. (Also done for Fractals in previous
	  commit...)
	* progs/demos/Fractals/fractals.c: A few minor changes: * glutInit*()
	  calls should precede glutInit(), per se, generally. This is so that
	  glutInit()'s configuration (which picks up on user parameters) can
	  override application defaults. * glutInit() should be called before
	  ANY attempt to process {argv, argc}. This is because there may be
	  GLUT/freeglut parameters (such as "-display" on X11). * If the window
	  is tall and skinny, rather than short and squat, we need to handle
	  aspect ratios differently.
	  
	  The first is a user-interface bug. The second is a serious bug
	  (especially since the demo assumes that argv[1] contains a filename).
	  The third is a display bug.

2003-10-08  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Changed CreateNotify (in X11 ONLY) to act like a
	  ConfigureNotify event.
	  
	  This is done so that subwindows on X11 will get "resize" events when
	  they are created. Old GLUT did this---presumably by design in order to
	  ensure that (a) All windows get notified of their size as soon as the
	  window exists, and (b) probably more importantly, so that windows and
	  sub-windows behave as much alike as possible. I believe that GLUT was
	  right to do this, and I believe that compatibility requires this (I
	  have a sample program that breaks in freeglut but not GLUT without
	  this fix).
	  
	  I did not touch the Microsoft side, because I don't know what their OS
	  does---nor if old GLUT was historically system-dependent about this.

	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_menu.c: freeglut_menu.c:217,519,532: Fix menus
	  to stay in the window (John Fay)

2003-10-08  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_menu.c: Several updates from John and myself.
	  
	  The broad outlines are:
	  
	  * Color schemes are now in variables, are closer to old GLUT, and are
	  system dependent (as old GLUT did). * You can change the font to any
	  bitmapped font more easily, which can aid in finding a better
	  approximation. (Old GLUT does not seem to have used a GLUT font for
	  the menus, which causes problems for us.) The menus rescale
	  automatically, including the triangle "arrow" for sub-menus. * Menus
	  have real borders, and the placement of highlighting is much improved.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Fixed a bug in the menu callback behavior. Menus
	  were not setting the current window correctly.

	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_structure.c: Tweaking for
	  menu behavior in Linux regarding mouse whatnot - John Fay

2003-10-01  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Applied a patch from "extraeme@netbsd.org" to
	  add joystick support. Untested, but it compiles for me.
	  
	  Should also add Joystick support for older FreeBSD systems. Also
	  untested.
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Added support for more arbitrary number of mouse
	  buttons (though only the first three can work with menus), in X. This
	  closes a compatibility gap with old GLUT, and leaves us the option of
	  supporting scroll-wheels properly.

2003-09-27  Christopher John Purnell

	* progs/demos/Fractals/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Lorenz/Makefile.am, progs/demos/One/Makefile.am: Don't
	  install the demos.

2003-09-26  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* progs/demos/Makefile.am: Package the demos.dsw file.
	* progs/demos/demos.dsw: Demos workspace for MSVC users

2003-09-24  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Corrected a bug w.r.t. display and joystick
	  events. When getting ready to sleep, we need to go through ALL windows
	  to check for pending joysticks and to check for pending redisplays. I
	  was just going through all TOP- LEVEL windows. Eeek. This won't do.

2003-09-23  Brian Paul

	* progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: added needClear flag to
	  take care of initial window clear and window resize clears

2003-09-23  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_init.c: Per Nigel Stewart's comments, converted
	  
	  #ifdef TARGET_HOST_...
	  
	  to:
	  
	  #if TARGET_HOST_...
	  
	  in src/freeglut_init.c. These changes should not have any functional
	  impact at this time, but you don't want bad examples lying around to
	  trip people up later.
	* progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_window.c: Fixed: * GLUT_SINGLE now should behave more or
	  less correctly. Thanks to Brian Paul!
	  
	  * Sleeping is now cognizant of outstanding redisplays.
	  
	  * Fractals_random has been restored more or less to as-before, save
	  that it uses the more minimal glFlush() rather than glutSwapBuffers().
	  glutSwapBuffers() was only required when freeglut was incorrectly
	  handling promotion to double-buffering.

2003-09-22  rkrolib

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Moved the #include/#ifdef/#define stuff up to the
	  top.
	  
	  Changed #ifdef to #if, per Nigel(?)'s comment. Ooops.

2003-09-22  Christopher John Purnell

	* progs/demos/Fractals/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Lorenz/Makefile.am, progs/demos/One/Makefile.am: Fix to
	  allow demos to compile before freeglut has been installed.

2003-09-22  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: Add an idle function to
	  ensure that the screen gets drawn even when callbacks are not
	  generated by the mouse/keyboard.

2003-09-21  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* progs/demos/Fractals/fractals.c,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: Note the possible
	  buffer overflow in window_title
	* progs/demos/Fractals/fractals.c: Fix the window title.
	* progs/demos/Fractals_random/fractals_random.c: Fix window title, and
	  ensure that the random integer is not forced to be zero (Thanks
	  Richard Rauch!)

2003-09-20  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/freeglut_main.c: Richard Rauch's patch to ensure that freeglut
	  does not use 100% CPU even while idling.
	* src/freeglut_font.c: Resolution for bug 809561 reported by Nigel
	  Stewart, regarding a possible array underflow error of -1 in the event
	  of "character" being zero.

2003-09-14  Christopher John Purnell

	* configure.in, progs/demos/Fractals/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Lorenz/Makefile.am, progs/demos/One/Makefile.am,
	  src/Makefile.am: Removed unused AC_PROG_RANLIB from configure.in Added
	  passing of $(X_CFLAGS) to compiler.

2003-09-14  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/GL/glut.h: Resolve bug 806008 -- let Microsoft's compiler know
	  to use Windows libraries even if not using our project files.

2003-09-13  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog: Taking care of keeping things mostly up-to-date
	* TODO: Most everything's been resolved for the 2.0.0 release.
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Thierry Thomas said that FreeBSD has no
	  machine/joystick.h, instead a sys/joystick.h. I've made the change --
	  here's hoping it works.
	* progs/demos/One/one.c: Removed the incorrect relative path for
	  including freeglut.h
	* progs/demos/Fractals/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Fractals_random/Makefile.am,
	  progs/demos/Lorenz/Makefile.am, progs/demos/One/Makefile.am: Made all
	  demos compile. Thanks to Thierry Thomas for reporting bug 802809,
	  which alerted that *none* of the demos compiled automatically!
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Nigel Stewart's joystick fix (for hopefully all
	  platforms), SourceForge bug 805481
	* progs/demos/Lorenz/lorenz.dsp, progs/demos/One/one.dsp: Fix location
	  of the include files from a fixed to relative path. Closes bug 805477
	* freeglut.dsp, freeglut.dsw, freeglut_static.dsp, freeglutstatic.dsw:
	  Add dos line endings. Fixes bug 805476

2003-09-10  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: A minor fix to that last commit.
	* src/freeglut_joystick.c: Removed some remaining glib depandancy.

2003-09-02  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_window.c: Fix to stop fgSetWindow(NULL) crashing on X11.

2003-08-29  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/freeglut_main.c, src/freeglut_menu.c, src/freeglut_structure.c:
	  These change a bunch of assignments to calls to set the current window
	  correctly, and also (possibly) fixes most of the remaining menu
	  problem. - John Fay
	* src/freeglut_main.c: Another typecast bugfix from John Fay

2003-08-28  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_init.c: Changed #ifdef to #if

	* include/GL/freeglut_ext.h, include/GL/glut.h: Changes stroke function
	  arguments from "const char*" to "const unsigned char *" - John Fay

2003-08-28  Christopher John Purnell

	* freeglut-1.3: Removing files from old freeglut-1.3 directory.

2003-08-28  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/freeglut_callbacks.c, src/freeglut_geometry.c,
	  src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_joystick.c, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_menu.c, src/freeglut_structure.c: Casting changes, John
	  Fay

2003-08-27  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/freeglut_init.c, src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_main.c,
	  src/freeglut_menu.c: Major overhaul to the menu system, by John Fay

	  correct place.

2003-08-17  Christopher John Purnell

	* ChangeLog, src/freeglut_gamemode.c, src/freeglut_internal.h,
	  src/freeglut_window.c: Game mode fixes from Bernhard Kaindl and Eric
	  Espie.

2003-08-05  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/Makefile.am, src/freeglut_menu.c, src/freeglut_window.c,
	  src/mwmborder.c: Using override_redirect instead of motif wm hints. It
	  now rasies the menu windows before showing them. Move the show to
	  after the reshape and position so we don't get a flash of the menu
	  window at it's old size and position.
	* src/mwmborder.c: I suspect a lot of people will not have motif
	  installed.

2003-08-05  Eric Sandall

	* ChangeLog, src/Makefile.am, src/freeglut_window.c: (98)
	  src/Makefile.am:34 Added mwmborder.c (99) src/freeglut_window.c:67
	  Removed #included "mwmborder.c"

	  glutGet(GLUT_WINDOW_BORDER_WIDTH) and
	  glutGet(GLUT_WINDOW_HEADER_HEIGHT).
	* src/freeglut_internal.h, src/freeglut_state.c: Replacing
	  glutGet(GLUT_WINDOW_X) and glutGet(GLUT_WINDOW_Y) on X11 with
	  something that works. Also a minor correction to the xf86vidmode
	  autoconf stuff.

2003-08-04  James Jones <puggles@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/freeglut_window.c: Keep the X11 decoration-zapping code confined
	  to X11-using platforms! Oops!
	* src/freeglut_window.c, src/mwmborder.c: Menus' decorations are removed
	  on Linux. Not sure if we want the mwmborder.c a separate file or not;
	  doing it separate for right now. Makefile was not updated, since the
	  .c is just #included.

2003-08-03  Christopher John Purnell

	* configure.in: Got rid of configure warnings when using a newer
	  autoconf

2003-08-02  Christopher John Purnell

	* src/freeglut_glutfont_definitions.c, src/freeglut_internal.h: Putting
	  stuff back that was undone with the menu code committed.

	  rendering context) by John Fay and a little by James C. Jones. They
	  work perfectly on Win32, and work... on Linux.

2003-08-01  Christopher John Purnell

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/freeglut_glutfont_definitions.c,
	  src/freeglut_internal.h: Added autoconf detection for the xf86 vid
	  mode extensions.

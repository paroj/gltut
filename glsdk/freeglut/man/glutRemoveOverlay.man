.SH NAME
glutRemoveOverlay - removes the overlay (if one exists) from the current window.
.SH SYNTAX
.nf
.LP
void glutRemoveOverlay(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
glutRemoveOverlay removes the overlay (if one exists). It is safe
to call glutRemoveOverlay even if no overlay is currently
established--it does nothing in this case. Implicitly, the window's
layer in use changes to the normal plane immediately once the
overlay is removed.

If the program intends to re-establish the overlay later, it is typically
faster and less resource intensive to use glutHideOverlay and
glutShowOverlay to simply change the display status of the
overlay.

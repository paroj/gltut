.SH NAME
glutSwapBuffers - swaps the buffers of the current window if double buffered.
.SH SYNTAX
.nf
.LP
void glutSwapBuffers(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Performs a buffer swap on the layer in use for the current window.
Specifically, glutSwapBuffers promotes the contents of the back
buffer of the layer in use of the current window to become the contents
of the front buffer. The contents of the back buffer then become
undefined. The update typically takes place during the vertical retrace of
the monitor, rather than immediately after glutSwapBuffers is called.

An implicit glFlush is done by glutSwapBuffers before it returns.
Subsequent OpenGL commands can be issued immediately after calling
glutSwapBuffers, but are not executed until the buffer exchange is
completed.

If the layer in use is not double buffered, glutSwapBuffers has no
effect.

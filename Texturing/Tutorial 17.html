    <p>Previously, we have seen textures used to vary surface parameters. But we can use textures
        to vary something else: light intensity. In this way, we can simulate light sources who's
        intensity changes with something more than just distance from the light.</p>
    <p>Our first effort in varying light intensity with textures will be to build an incandescent
        flashlight. The light beam from a flashlight is not a single solid intensity, due to the way
        the mirrors focus the light. A texture is the simplest way to define this pattern of light
        intensity.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp12265"></a>Post-Projection Space</h2></div></div></div>
        
        
        <p>Before we can look at how to use a texture to make a flashlight, we need to make a
            short digression. Perspective projection will be an important part of how we make a
            texture into a flashlight, so we need to revisit perspective projection. Specifically,
            we need to look at what happens when transforming after a perspective projection
            operation.</p>
        <p>Open up the project called <span class="propername">Double Projection</span>. It
            renders four objects, using various textures, in a scene with a single directional light
            and a green point light.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp12270"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 17.1. Double Projection</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="DoubleProjection.png" alt="Double Projection"></div>
        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>This tutorial displays two images of the same scene. The image on the left is the view
            of the scene from one camera, while the image on the right is the view of the scene from
            another camera. The difference between the two cameras is mainly in where the camera
            transformation matrices are applied.</p>
        <p>The left camera works normally. It is controlled by the left mouse button, the mouse
            wheel, and the WASD keys, as normal. The right camera however provides the view
            direction that is applied after the perspective projection matrix. The sequence of
            transforms thus looks like this: Model -&gt; Left Camera -&gt; Projection -&gt; Right Camera. The
            right camera is controlled by the right mouse button; only orientation controls work on
            it.</p>
        <p>The idea is to be able to look at the shape of objects in normalized device coordinate
                (<acronym class="acronym">NDC</acronym>) space after a perspective projection. NDC space is a [-1,
            1] box centered at the origin; by rotating objects in NDC space, you will be able to see
            what those objects look like from a different perspective. Pressing the
                <span class="keycap"><strong>SpaceBar</strong></span> will reset the right camera back to a neutral view.</p>
        <p>Note that post-perspective projection space objects are very distorted, particularly
            in the Z direction. Also, recall one of the fundamental tricks of the perspective
            projection: it rescales objects based on their Z-distance from the camera. Thus, objects
            that are farther away are physically smaller in NDC space than closer ones. Thus,
            rotating NDC space around will produce results that are not intuitively what you might
            expect and may be very disorienting at first.</p>
        <p>For example, if we rotate the right camera to an above view, relative to whatever the
            left camera is, we see that all of the objects seems to shrink down into a very small
            width.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp12282"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 17.2. Top View Projection</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="ProjectTopView.png" alt="Top View Projection"></div>
        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>This is due to the particulars of the perspective projection's work on the Z
            coordinate. The Z coordinate in NDC space is the result of the clip-space Z divided by
            the negative of the camera-space Z. This forces it into the [-1, 1] range, but the
            clip-space Z also is affected by the zNear and zFar of the perspective matrix. The wider
            these are, the more narrowly the Z is compressed. Objects farther from the camera are
            compressed into smaller ranges of Z; we saw this in our look at the effect of the camera
            Z-range on precision. Close objects use more of the [-1, 1] range than those farther
            away.</p>
        <p>This can be seen by moving the left camera close to an object. The right camera, from
            a top-down view, has a much thicker view of that object in the Z direction.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp12289"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 17.3. Near View Projection</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>Pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>Y</strong></span> key will toggle depth clamping in the right camera.
            This can explain some of the unusual things that will be seen there. Sometimes the wrong
            objects will appear on top of each other; when this happens, it is almost always due to
            a clamped depth.</p>
        <p>The reason why depth clamping matters so much in the right screen is obvious if you
            think about it. NDC space is a [-1, 1] cube. But that is not the NDC space we actually
            render to. We are rendering to a rotated portion of this space. So the actual [-1, 1]
            space that gets clipped or clamped is different from the one we see. We are effectively
            rotating a cube and cutting off any parts of it that happen to be outside of the cubic
            viewing area. And since the initial cube is so skewed to far Z values, often times large
            chunks of the world fall out of the viewing cube.</p>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp12297"></a>Scene Graphs</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>This is the first code in the tutorial to use the scene graph part of the
                framework. The term <em class="glossterm">scene graph</em> refers to a piece of software
                that manages a collection of objects, typically in some kind of object hierarchy. In
                this case, the <code class="filename">Scene.h</code> part of the framework contains a class
                that loads an XML description of a scene. This description includes meshes, shaders,
                and textures to load. These assets are then associated with named objects within the
                scene. So a mesh combined with a shader can be rendered with one or more
                textures.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this system is to remove a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of the
                boilerplate code from the tutorial files. The setup work for the scene graph is far
                less complicated than the setup work seen in previous tutorials.</p>
            <p>As an example, here is the scene graph to load and link a particular
                shader:</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp12305"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 17.1. Scene Graph Shader Definition</b></p><div class="example-contents">
                
                <pre class="programlisting">&lt;prog
    xml:id="p_unlit"
    vert="Unlit.vert"
    frag="Unlit.frag"
    model-to-camera="modelToCameraMatrix"&gt;
    &lt;block name="Projection" binding="0"/&gt;
&lt;/prog&gt;</pre>
            </div></div><br class="example-break">
            <p>The <code class="literal">xml:id</code> gives it a name; this is used by objects in the
                scene to refer to this program. It also provides a way for other code to talk to it.
                Most of the rest is self-explanatory. <code class="literal">model-to-camera</code> deserves
                some explanation.</p>
            <p>Rendering the scene graph is done by calling the scene graph's render function
                with a camera matrix. Since the objects in the scene graph store their own
                transformations, the scene graph combines each object's local transform with the
                given camera matrix. But it still needs to know how to provide that matrix to the
                shader. Thus, <code class="literal">model-to-camera</code> specifies the name of the
                    <span class="type">mat4</span> uniform that receives the model-to-camera transformation
                matrix. There is a similar matrix for normals that is given the inverse-transpose of
                the model-to-camera matrix.</p>
            <p>The <code class="literal">block</code> element is the way we associate a uniform block in
                the program with a uniform block binding point. There is a similar element for
                    <code class="literal">sampler</code> that specifies which texture unit that a particular
                GLSL sampler is bound to.</p>
            <p>Objects in scene graph systems are traditionally called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">nodes,</span>”</span> and
                this scene graph is no exception.</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp12319"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 17.2. Scene Graph Node Definition</b></p><div class="example-contents">

    &lt;texture name="t_stone_pillar" unit="0" sampler="anisotropic"/&gt;
&lt;/node&gt;</pre>
            </div></div><br class="example-break">
            <p>Nodes have a number of properties. They have a name, so that other code can
                reference them. They have a mesh that they render and a program they use to render
                that mesh. They have a position, orientation, and scale transform. The orientation
                is specified as a quaternion, with the W component specified last (this is different
                from how <span class="type">glm::fquat</span> specifies it. The W there comes first). The order
                of these transforms is scale, then orientation, then translation.</p>
            <p>This node also has a texture bound to it. <code class="literal">t_stone_pillar</code> was a
                texture that was loaded in a <code class="literal">texture</code> command. The
                    <code class="literal">unit</code> property specifies the texture unit to use. And the
                    <code class="literal">sampler</code> property defines which of the predefined samplers to
                use. In this case, it uses a sampler with ansiotropic filtering to the maximum
                degree allowed by the hardware. The texture wrapping modes of this sampler are to
                wrap the S and T coordinates.</p>
            <p>This is what the C++ setup code looks like for the entire scene:</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp12330"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 17.3. Double Projection LoadAndSetupScene</b></p><div class="example-contents">

            </div></div><br class="example-break">
            <p>This code does some fairly simple things. The scene graph system is good, but we
                still need to be able to control uniforms not in blocks manually from external code.
                Specifically in this case, the number of lights is a uniform, not a uniform block.
                To do this, we need to use a uniform state binder,
                    <code class="varname">g_lightNumBinder</code>, and set it into all of the nodes in the
                scene. This binder allows us to set the uniform for all of the objects (regardless
                of which program they use).</p>
            <p>The <code class="literal">p_unlit</code> shader is never actually used in the scene graph;
                we just use the scene graph as a convenient way to load the shader. Similarly, the
                    <code class="literal">m_sphere</code> mesh is not used in a scene graph node. We pull
                references to both of these out of the graph and use them ourselves where needed. We
                extract some uniform locations from the unlit shader, so that we can draw unlit
                objects with colors.</p>
            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
                <p>The code as written here is designed to be exception safe. Most of the
                    functions that find nodes by name will throw if the name is not found. What this
                    exception safety means is that it is easy to make the scene reloadable. It only
                    replaces the old values in the global variables after executing all of the code
                    that could throw an exception. This way, the entire scene, along with all
                    meshes, textures, and shaders, can be reloaded by pressing
                        <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span>. If something goes wrong, the new scene will not be
                    loaded and an error message is displayed.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Two of the objects in the scene rotate. This is easily handled using our list of
                objects. In the <code class="function">display</code> method, we access certain nodes and
                change their transforms them:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">g_nodes[0].NodeSetOrient(glm::rotate(glm::fquat(),
    360.0f * g_timer.GetAlpha(), glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f)));

g_nodes[3].NodeSetOrient(g_spinBarOrient * glm::rotate(glm::fquat(),
    360.0f * g_timer.GetAlpha(), glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f)));</pre>
            <p>We simply set the orientation based on a timer. For the second one, we previously
                stored the object's orientation after loading it, and use that as the reference.
                This allows us to rotate about its local Z axis.</p>

            <p>The split-screen trick used here is actually quite simple to pull off. It's also
                one of the advantages of the scene graph: the ability to easily re-render the same
                scene multiple times.</p>
            <p>The first thing that must change is that the projection matrix cannot be set in
                the old <code class="function">reshape</code> function. That function now only sets the new
                width and height of the screen into global variables. This is important because we
                will be using two projection matrices.</p>
            <p>The projection matrix used for the left scene is set up like this:</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp12351"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 17.4. Left Projection Matrix</b></p><div class="example-contents">

            </div></div><br class="example-break">
            <p>Notice that <code class="varname">displaySize</code> uses only half of the width. And this
                half width is passed into the <code class="function">glViewport</code> call. It is also used

            <p>Notice that we first take the camera matrix from the perspective view and apply it
                to the matrix stack before the perspective projection itself. Remember that
                transforms applied to the stack happen in <span class="emphasis"><em>reverse</em></span> order. This
                means that vertices are projected into 4D homogeneous clip-space coordinates, then
                are transformed by a matrix. Only the rotation portion of the right camera matrix is
                used. The translation is removed by the conversion to a <span class="type">mat3</span> (which
                takes only the top-left 3x3 part of the matrix, which if you recall contains the
                rotation), then turns it back into a <span class="type">mat4</span>.</p>
            <p>Notice also that the viewport's X location is biased based on whether the
                display's width is odd or not (<code class="literal">g_displayWidth % 2</code> is 0 if it is
                even, 1 if it is odd). This means that if the width is stretched to an odd number,
                there will be a one pixel gap between the two views of the scene.</p>

            <p>One question may occur to you: how is it possible for our right camera to provide
                a rotation in NDC space, if it is being applied to the end of the projection matrix?
                After all, the projection matrix goes from camera space to
                <span class="emphasis"><em>clip</em></span>-space. The clip-space to NDC space transform is done by
                OpenGL after our vertex shader has done this matrix multiply. Do we not need the
                shader to divide the clip-space values by W, then do the rotation?</p>
            <p>Obviously not, since this code works. But just because code happens to work
                doesn't mean that it should. So let's see if we can prove that it does. To do this,
                we must prove this:</p>

            </div>
            <p>This might look like a simple proof by inspection due to the associative nature of
                these, but it is not. The reason is quite simple: w and w' may not be the same. The
                value of w is the fourth component of v; w' is the fourth component of what results
                from T*v. If T changes w, then the equation is not true. But at the same time, if T
                doesn't change w, if w == w', then the equation is true.</p>
            <p>Well, that makes things quite simple. We simply need to ensure that our T does not
                alter w. Matrix multiplication tells us that w' is the dot product of v and the
                bottom row of T.</p>

            <p>Therefore, if the bottom row of T is (0, 0, 0, 1), then w == w'. And therefore, we
                can use T before the division. Fortunately, the only matrix we have that has a
                different bottom row is the projection matrix, and T is the rotation matrix we apply
                after projection.</p>
            <p>So this works, as long as we use the right matrices. We can rotate, translate, and
                scale post-projective clip-space exactly as we would post-projective NDC space.
                Which is good, because we get to preserve the w component for perspective-correct
                interpolation.</p>
            <p>The take-home lesson here is very simple: projections are not that special as far
                as transforms are concerned. Post-projective space is mostly just another space. It
                may be a 4-dimensional homogeneous coordinate system, and that may be an odd thing
                to fully understand. But that does not mean that you can't apply a regular matrix to
                objects in this space.</p>

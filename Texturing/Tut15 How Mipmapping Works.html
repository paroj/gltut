        <p>Previously, we discussed mipmap selection and interpolation in terms related to the
            geometry of the object. That is true, but only when we are dealing with simple texture
            mapping schemes, such as when the texture coordinates are attached directly to vertex
            positions. But as we saw in our first tutorial on texturing, texture coordinates can be
            entirely arbitrary. So how does mipmap selection and anisotropic filtering work
            then?</p>
        <p>Very carefully.</p>
        <p>Imagine a 2x2 pixel area of the screen. Now imagine that four fragment shaders, all
            from the same triangle, are executing for that screen area. Since the fragment shaders
            from the same triangle are all guaranteed to have the same uniforms and the same code,
            the only thing that is different among them is the fragment inputs. And because they are
            executing the same code, you can conceive of them executing in lockstep. That is, each
            of them executes the same instruction, on their individual dataset, at the same
            time.</p>
        <p>Under that assumption, for any particular value in a fragment shader, you can pick the
            corresponding 3 other values in the other fragment shaders executing alongside it. If
            that value is based solely on uniform or constant data, then each shader will have the
            same value. But if it is based on input values (in part or in whole), then each shader
            may have a different value, based on how it was computed and what those inputs
            were.</p>
        <p>So, let's look at the texture coordinate value; the particular value used to access
            the texture. Each shader has one. If that value is associated with the triangle's
            vertices, via perspective-correct interpolation and so forth, then the
                <span class="emphasis"><em>difference</em></span> between the shaders' values will represent the
            window space geometry of the triangle. There are two dimensions for a difference, and
            therefore there are two differences: the difference in the window space X axis, and the
            window space Y axis.</p>
        <p>These two differences, sometimes called gradients or derivatives, are how mipmapping
            actually works. If the texture coordinate used is just an interpolated input value,
            which itself is directly associated with a position, then the gradients represent the
            geometry of the triangle in window space. If the texture coordinate is computed in more
            unconventional ways, it still works, as the gradients represent how the texture
            coordinates are changing across the surface of the triangle.</p>
        <p>Having two gradients allows for the detection of anisotropy. And therefore, it
            provides enough information to reasonably apply anisotropic filtering algorithms.</p>
        <p>Now, you may notice that this process is very conditional. Specifically, it requires
            that you have 4 fragment shaders all running in lock-step. There are two circumstances
            where that might not happen.</p>
        <p>The most obvious is on the edge of a triangle, where a 2x2 block of neighboring
            fragments is not possible without being outside of the triangle area. This case is
            actually trivially covered by GPUs. No matter what, the GPU will rasterize each triangle
            in 2x2 blocks. Even if some of those blocks are not actually part of the triangle of
            interest, they will still get fragment shader time. This may seem inefficient, but it's
            reasonable enough in cases where triangles are not incredibly tiny or thin, which is
            quite often. The results produced by fragment shaders outside of the triangle are simply
            discarded.</p>
        <p>The other circumstance is through deliberate user intervention. Each fragment shader
            running in lockstep has the same uniforms but different inputs. Since they have
            different inputs, it is possible for them to execute a conditional branch based on these
            inputs (an if-statement or other conditional). This could cause, for example, the
            left-half of the 2x2 quad to execute certain code, while the other half executes
            different code. The 4 fragment shaders are no longer in lock-step. How does the GPU
            handle it?</p>
        <p>Well... it doesn't. Dealing with this requires manual user intervention, and it is a
            topic we will discuss later. Suffice it to say, it makes everything complicated.</p>

                <p>Vertex positions can be further manipulated after a perspective projection.
                    Thus the perspective transform is not special. The shape of objects in
                    post-projective space can be unusual and unexpected.</p>

                <p>Textures can be projected onto meshes. This is done by transforming those
                    meshes into the space of the texture, which is equivalent to transforming the
                    texture into the space of the meshes. The transform is governed by its own
                    camera matrix, as well as a projection matrix and a post-projective transform
                    that transforms it into the [0, 1] range of the texture.</p>

                <p>Cube maps are textures that have 6 face images for every mipmap level. The 6
                    faces are arranged in a cube. Texture coordinates are effectively directions of
                    a vector centered within the cube. Thus a cube map can provide a varying value
                    based on a direction in space.</p>

                    <p>In the spotlight project, change the projection texture coordinate from a
                        full 4D coordinate to a 2D. Do this by performing the divide-by-W step
                        directly in the vertex shader, and simply pass the ST coordinates to the
                        fragment shader. Just use <code class="function">texture</code> instead of
                            <code class="function">textureProj</code> in the fragment shader. See how that
                        affects things. Also, try doing the perspective divide in the fragment
                        shader and see how this differs from doing it in the vertex shader.</p>

                        non-perspective-correct interpolation changes the projection.</p>

                    <p>Instead of using a projective texture, build a lighting system for spot
                        lights entirely within the shader. It should have a maximum angle; the
                        larger the angle, the wider the spotlight. It should also have an inner
                        angle that is smaller than the maximum angle. This the the point where the
                        light starts falling off. At the maximum angle, the light intensity goes to
                        zero; at the minimum angle, the light intensity is full. The key here is
                        remembering that the dot product between the spotlight's direction and the
                        direction from the surface to the light is the cosine of the angle between
                        the two vectors. The <code class="function">acos</code> function can be used to
                        compute the angle (in radians) from the cosine.</p>

            <p>Cube maps are fairly old technology. The version used in GPUs today derive from
                the Renderman standard and earlier works. However, before hardware that allowed
                cubemaps became widely available, there were alternative techniques that were used
                to achieve similar effects.</p>
            <p>The basic idea behind all of these is to transform a 3D vector direction into a 2D
                texture coordinate. Note that converting a 3D direction into a 2D plane is a problem
                that was encountered long before computer graphics. It is effectively the global
                mapping problem: how you create a 2D map of a 3D spherical surface. All of these
                techniques introduce some distance distortion into the 2D map. Some distortion is
                more acceptable in certain circumstances than others.</p>
            <p>One of the more common pre-cube map techniques was sphere mapping. This required a
                very heavily distorted 2D texture, so the results left something to be desired. But
                the 3D-to-2D computations were simple enough to be encoded into early graphics
                hardware, or performed quickly on the CPU, so it was acceptable as a stop-gap. Other
                techniques, such as dual paraboloid mapping, were also used. The latter used a pair
                of textures, so they ate up more resources. But they required less heavy distortions
                of the texture, so in some cases, they were a better tradeoff.</p>

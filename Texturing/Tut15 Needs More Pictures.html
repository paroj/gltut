        <p>Speaking of distracting, let's talk about what is going on in the distance. When the
            camera moves, the more distant parts of the texture look like a jumbled mess. Even when
            the camera motion is paused, it still doesn't look like a checkerboard.</p>
        <p>What is going on there is really simple. The way our filtering works is that, for a
            given texture coordinate, we take either the nearest texel value, or the nearest 4
            texels and interpolate. The problem is that, for distant areas of our surface, the
            texture space area covered by our fragment is much larger than 4 texels across.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp11764"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 15.5. Large Minification Sampling</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="LargeMinificDiag.svg" alt="Large Minification Sampling"></div>
        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>The inner box represents the nearest texels, while the outer box represents the entire
            fragment mapped area. We can see that the value we get with nearest sampling will be
            pure white, since the four nearest values are white. But the value we should get based
            on the covered area is some shade of gray.</p>
        <p>In order to accurately represent this area of the texture, we would need to sample
            from more than just 4 texels. The GPU is certainly capable of detecting the fragment
            area and sampling enough values from the texture to be representative. But this would be
            exceedingly expensive, both in terms of texture bandwidth and computation.</p>
        <p>What if, instead of having to sample more texels, we had a number of smaller versions
            of our texture? The smaller versions effectively pre-compute groups of texels. That way,
            we could just sample 4 texels from a texture that is close enough to the size of our
            fragment area.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp11772"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 15.6. Mipmapped Minification Sampling</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="MipmapDiagram.svg" alt="Mipmapped Minification Sampling"></div>
        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>These smaller versions of an image are called <em class="glossterm">mipmaps</em>; they are
            also sometimes called mipmap levels. Previously, it was said that textures can store
            multiple images. The additional images, for many texture types, are mipmaps. By
            performing linear sampling against a lower mipmap level, we get a gray value that, while
            not the exact color the coverage area suggests, is much closer to what we should get
            than linear filtering on the large mipmap.</p>
        <p>In OpenGL, mipmaps are numbered starting from 0. The 0 image is the largest mipmap,
            what is usually considered the main texture image. When people speak of a texture having
            a certain size, they mean the resolution of mipmap level 0. Each mipmap is half as small
            as the previous one. So if our main image, mipmap level 0, has a size of 128x128, the
            next mipmap, level 1, is 64x64. The next is 32x32. And so forth, down to 1x1 for the
            smallest mipmap.</p>
        <p>For textures that are not square (which as we saw in the previous tutorial, is
            perfectly legitimate), the mipmap chain keeps going until all dimensions are 1. So a
            texture who's size is 128x16 (remember: the texture's size is the size of the largest
            mipmap) would have just as many mipmap levels as a 128x128 texture. The mipmap level 4
            of the 128x16 texture would be 8x1; the next mipmap would be 4x1.</p>
        <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p>It is also perfectly legal to have texture sizes that are not powers of two. For
                them, mipmap sizes are always rounded down. So a 129x129 texture's mipmap 1 will be 64x64.
                A 131x131 texture's mipmap 1 will be 65x65, and mipmap 2 will be 32x32.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The DDS image format is one of the few image formats that actually supports storing
            all of the mipmaps for a texture in the same file. Most image formats only allow one
            image in a single file. The texture loading code for our 128x128 texture with mipmaps is
            as follows:</p>
        <div class="example"><a name="idp11784"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 15.1. DDS Texture Loading with Mipmaps</b></p><div class="example-contents">
            
            <pre class="programlisting">std::string filename(LOCAL_FILE_DIR);
filename += "checker.dds";

std::auto_ptr&lt;glimg::ImageSet&gt; pImageSet(glimg::loaders::dds::LoadFromFile(filename.c_str()));

glGenTextures(1, &amp;g_checkerTexture);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, g_checkerTexture);

for(int mipmapLevel = 0; mipmapLevel &lt; pImageSet-&gt;GetMipmapCount(); mipmapLevel++)
{
    glimg::SingleImage image = pImageSet-&gt;GetImage(mipmapLevel, 0, 0);
    glimg::Dimensions dims = pImage-&gt;GetDimensions();
    
    glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, mipmapLevel, GL_RGB8, dims.width, dims.height, 0,
        GL_BGRA, GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV, image.GetImageData());
}

glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL, 0);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL, pImageSet-&gt;GetMipmapCount() - 1);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0);</pre>
        </div></div><br class="example-break">
        <p>Because the file contains multiple mipmaps, we must load each one in turn. The GL
            Image library considers each mipmap to be its own image. The
                <code class="function">GetDimensions</code> member of
                <code class="classname">glimg::SingleImage</code> returns the size of the particular
            mipmap.</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">glTexImage2D</code> function takes the mipmap level to load as the
            second parameter. The width and height parameters represent the size of the mipmap in
            question, not the size of the base level.</p>
        <p>Notice that the last statements have changed. The
                <code class="literal">GL_TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL</code> and <code class="literal">GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL</code>
            parameters tell OpenGL what mipmaps in our texture can be used. This represents a closed
            range. Since a 128x128 texture has 8 mipmaps, we use the range [0, 7]. The base level of
            a texture is the largest usable mipmap level, while the max level is the smallest usable
            level. It is possible to omit some of the smaller mipmap levels. Note that level 0 is
            always the largest possible mipmap level.</p>
        <p>Filtering based on mipmaps is unsurprisingly named <em class="glossterm">mipmap
                filtering</em>. This tutorial does not load two checkerboard textures; it
            only ever uses one checkerboard. The reason mipmaps have not been used until now is
            because mipmap filtering was not activated. Setting the base and max level is not
            enough; the sampler object must be told to use mipmap filtering. If it does not, then it
            will simply use the base level.</p>
        <p>Mipmap filtering only works for minification, since minification represents a fragment
            area that is larger than the texture's resolution. To activate this, we use a special
                <code class="literal">MIPMAP</code> mode of minification filtering.</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">glSamplerParameteri(g_samplers[2], GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
glSamplerParameteri(g_samplers[2], GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST);</pre>
        <p>The <code class="literal">GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST</code> minification filter means the
            following. For a particular call to the GLSL <code class="function">texture</code> function, it
            will detect which mipmap is the one that is nearest to our fragment area. This detection
            is based on the angle of the surface relative to the camera's view<a href="#ftn.idp11803" class="footnote" name="idp11803"><sup class="footnote">[8]</sup></a>. Then, when it samples from that mipmap, it will use linear filtering of the
            four nearest samples within that one mipmap.</p>
        <p>If you press the <span class="keycap"><strong>3</strong></span> key in the tutorial, you can see the effects of
            this filtering mode.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp11807"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 15.7. Hallway with Mipmapping</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

        <p>That's a lot more reasonable. It isn't perfect, but it is much better than the random
            motion in the distance that we have previously seen.</p>
        <p>It can be difficult to truly understand the effects of mipmap filtering when using
            normal textures and mipmaps. Therefore, if you press the <span class="keycap"><strong>Spacebar</strong></span>, the
            tutorial will switch to a special texture. It is not loaded from a file; it is instead
            constructed at runtime.</p>
        <p>Normally, mipmaps are simply smaller versions of larger images, using linear filtering
            or various other algorithms to compute a reasonable scaled down result. This special
            texture's mipmaps are all flat colors, but each mipmap has a different color. This makes
            it much more obvious where each mipmap is.</p>

        <p>Now we can really see where the different mipmaps are. They don't quite line up on the
            corners. But remember: this just shows the mipmap boundaries, not the texture
            coordinates themselves.</p>

            <p>The special mipmap viewing texture is interesting, as it demonstrates an issue you
                may need to work with when uploading certain textures: alignment.</p>
            <p>The checkerboard texture, though it only stores black and white values, actually
                has all three color channels, plus a fourth value. Since each channel is stored as
                8-bit unsigned normalized integers, each pixel takes up 4 * 8 or 32 bits, which is 4
                bytes.</p>
            <p>OpenGL image uploading and downloading is based on horizontal rows of image data.
                Each row is expected to have a certain byte alignment. The OpenGL default is 4
                bytes; since our pixels are 4 bytes in length, every mipmap will have a line size in
                bytes that is a multiple of 4 bytes. Even the 1x1 mipmap level is 4 bytes in
                size.</p>
            <p>Note that the internal format we provide is <code class="literal">GL_RGB8</code>, even
                though the components we are transferring are <code class="literal">GL_BGRA</code> (the A
                being the fourth component). This means that OpenGL will more or less discard the
                fourth component we upload. That is fine.</p>
            <p>The issue with the special texture's pixel data is that it is not 4 bytes in
                length. The function used to generate a mipmap level of the special texture is as
                follows:</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp11831"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 15.2. Special Texture Data</b></p><div class="example-contents">
                
                <pre class="programlisting">void FillWithColor(std::vector&lt;GLubyte&gt; &amp;buffer,
                   GLubyte red, GLubyte green, GLubyte blue,
                   int width, int height)
{
    int numTexels = width * height;
    buffer.resize(numTexels * 3);
    
    std::vector&lt;GLubyte&gt;::iterator it = buffer.begin();
    while(it != buffer.end())
    {
        *it++ = red;
        *it++ = green;
        *it++ = blue;
    }
}</pre>
            </div></div><br class="example-break">
            <p>This creates a texture that has 24-bit pixels; each pixel contains 3 bytes.</p>
            <p>That is fine for any width value that is a multiple of 4. However, if the width is
                2, then each row of pixel data will be 6 bytes long. That is not a multiple of 4 and
                therefore breaks alignment.</p>
            <p>Therefore, we must change the pixel alignment that OpenGL uses. The
                    <code class="function">LoadMipmapTexture</code> function is what generates the special
                texture. One of the first lines is this:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">GLint oldAlign = 0;
glGetIntegerv(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, &amp;oldAlign);
glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);</pre>
            <p>The first two lines gets the old alignment, so that we can reset it once we are
                finished. The last line uses <code class="function">glPixelStorei</code>
            </p>
            <p>Note that the GL Image library does provide an alignment value; it is part of the
                    <code class="classname">Dimensions</code> structure of an image. We have simply not used
                it yet. In the last tutorial, our row widths were aligned to 4 bytes, so there was
                no chance of a problem. In this tutorial, our image data is 4-bytes in pixel size,
                so it is always intrinsically aligned to 4 bytes.</p>
            <p>That being said, you should always keep row alignment in mind, particularly when
                dealing with mipmaps.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp11844"></a>Filtering Between Mipmaps</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>Our mipmap filtering has been a dramatic improvement over previous efforts.
                However, it does create artifacts. One of particular concern is the change between
                mipmap levels. It is abrupt and somewhat easy to notice for a moving scene. Perhaps
                there is a way to smooth that out.</p>
            <p>Our current minification filtering picks a single mipmap level and selects a
                sample from it. It would be better if we could pick the two nearest mipmap levels
                and blend between the values fetched from the two textures. This would give us a
                smoother transition from one mipmap level to the next.</p>
            <p>This is done by using <code class="literal">GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR</code> minification
                filtering. The first <code class="literal">LINEAR</code> represents the filtering done within
                a single mipmap level, and the second <code class="literal">LINEAR</code> represents the
                filtering done between mipmap levels.</p>
            <p>To see this in action, press the <span class="keycap"><strong>4</strong></span> key.</p>
            <div class="figure"><a name="idp11854"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 15.9. Linear Mipmap Linear Comparison</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

            </div></div><br class="figure-break">
            <p>That is an improvement. There are still issues to work out, but it is much harder
                to see where one mipmap ends and another begins.</p>
            <p>OpenGL actually allows all combinations of <code class="literal">NEAREST</code> and
                    <code class="literal">LINEAR</code> in minification filtering. Using nearest filtering
                within a mipmap level while linearly filtering between levels
                    (<code class="literal">GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR</code>) is possible but not terribly
                useful in practice.</p>
            <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Filtering Nomenclature</b></p></div></div></div>
                
                <p>If you are familiar with texture filtering from other sources, you may have
                    heard the terms <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bilinear filtering</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">trilinear
                        filtering</span>”</span> before. Indeed, you may know that linear filtering between
                    mipmap levels is commonly called trilinear filtering.</p>
                <p>This book does not use that terminology. And for good reason: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">trilinear
                        filtering</span>”</span> is a misnomer.</p>
                <p>To understand the problem, it is important to understand what <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bilinear
                        filtering</span>”</span> means. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bi</span>”</span> in bilinear comes from doing
                    linear filtering along the two axes of a 2D texture. So there is linear
                    filtering in the S and T directions (remember: standard OpenGL nomenclature
                    calls the 2D texture coordinate axes S and T); since that is two directions, it
                    is called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bilinear filtering</span>”</span>. Thus <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">trilinear</span>”</span> comes
                    from adding a third direction of linear filtering: between mipmap levels.</p>
                <p>Therefore, one could consider using <code class="literal">GL_LINEAR</code> mag and min
                    filtering to be bilinear, and using <code class="literal">GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR</code>
                    to be trilinear.</p>
                <p>That's all well and good... for 2D textures. But what about for 1D textures?
                    Since 1D textures are one dimensional, <code class="literal">GL_LINEAR</code> mag and min
                    filtering only filters in one direction: S. Therefore, it would be reasonable to
                    call 1D <code class="literal">GL_LINEAR</code> filtering simply <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">linear
                        filtering.</span>”</span> Indeed, filtering between mipmap levels of 1D textures
                    (yes, 1D textures can have mipmaps) would have to be called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bilinear
                        filtering.</span>”</span></p>
                <p>And then there are 3D textures. <code class="literal">GL_LINEAR</code> mag and min
                    filtering filters in all 3 directions: S, T, and R. Therefore, that would have
                    to be called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">trilinear filtering.</span>”</span> And if you add linear mipmap
                    filtering on top of that (yes, 3D textures can have mipmaps), it would be
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">quadrilinear filtering.</span>”</span></p>
                <p>Therefore, the term <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">trilinear filtering</span>”</span> means absolutely
                    nothing without knowing what the texture's type is. Whereas
                        <code class="literal">GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR</code> always has a well-defined meaning
                    regardless of the texture's type.</p>
                <p>Unlike geometry shaders, which ought to have been called primitive shaders,
                    OpenGL does not enshrine this common misnomer into its API. There is no
                        <code class="literal">GL_TRILINEAR</code> enum. Therefore, in this book, we can and
                    will use the proper terms for these.</p>

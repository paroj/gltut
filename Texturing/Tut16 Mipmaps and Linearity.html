        <p>The principle reason lighting functions require lRGB values is because they perform
            linear operations. They therefore produce inaccurate results on non-linear colors. This
            is not limited to lighting functions; <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> linear operations on
            colors require a lRGB value to produce a reasonable result.</p>
        <p>One important linear operation performed on texel values is filtering. Whether
            magnification or minification, non-nearest filtering does some kind of linear
            arithmetic. Since this is all handled by OpenGL, the question is this: if a texture is
            in an sRGB format, does OpenGL's texture filtering occur <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>
            converting the texel values to lRGB or after?</p>
        <p>The answer is quite simple: filtering comes after linearizing. So it does the right
            thing.</p>
        <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p>It's not quite that simple. The OpenGL specification technically leaves it
                undefined. However, if your hardware can run these tutorials without modifications
                (ie: your hardware is OpenGL 3.3 capable), then odds are it will do the right thing.
                It is only on pre-3.0 hardware where this is a problem.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A bigger question is this: do you generate the mipmaps correctly for your textures?
            Mipmap generation was somewhat glossed over in the last tutorial, as tools generally do
            this for you. In general, mipmap generation involves some form of linear operation on
            the colors. For this process to produce correct results for sRGB textures, it needs to
            linearize the sRGB color values, perform its filtering on them, then convert them back
            to sRGB for storage.</p>
        <p>Unless you are writing texture processing tools, this question is answered by asking
            your texture tools themselves. Most freely available texture tools are completely
            unaware of non-linear colorspaces. You can tell which ones are aware based on the
            options you are given at mipmap creation time. If you can specify a gamma for your
            texture, or if there is some setting to specify that the texture's colors are sRGB, then
            the tool can do the right thing. If no such option exists, then it cannot. For sRGB
            textures, you should use a gamma of 2.2, which is what sRGB approximates.</p>
        <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p>The DDS plugin for GIMP is a good, free tool that is aware of linear colorspaces.
                NVIDIA's command-line texture tools, also free, are as well.</p>
        </div>
        <p>To see how this can affect rendering, load up the <span class="propername">Gamma
                Checkers</span> project.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp12169"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 16.3. Gamma Checkers</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="Gamma%20Checkers.png" alt="Gamma Checkers"></div>
        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>This works like the filtering tutorials. The <span class="keycap"><strong>1</strong></span> and <span class="keycap"><strong>2</strong></span>
            keys respectively select linear mipmap filtering and anisotropic filtering (using the
            maximum possible anisotropy).</p>
        <p>We can see that this looks a bit different from the last time we saw it. The distant
            grey field is much darker than it was. This is because we are using sRGB colorspace
            textures. While the white and black are the same in sRGB (1.0 and 0.0 respectively), a
            50% blend of them (0.5) is not. The sRGB texture assumes the 0.5 color is the sRGB 0.5,
            so it becomes darker than we would expect.</p>
        <p>Initially, we render with no gamma correction. To toggle gamma correction, press the
                <span class="keycap"><strong>a</strong></span> key. This restores the view to what we saw previously.</p>
        <p>However, the texture we are using is actually wrong. 0.5, as previously stated, is not
            the sRGB color for a 50% blend of black and white. In the sRGB colorspace, that color
            would be ~0.73. The texture is wrong because its mipmaps were not generated in the
            correct colorspace.</p>
        <p>To switch to a texture who's mipmaps were properly generated, press the
                <span class="keycap"><strong>g</strong></span> key.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp12183"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 16.4. Gamma Correct with Gamma Mipmaps</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="Gamma%20Checkers%20Gamma.png" alt="Gamma Correct with Gamma Mipmaps"></div>
        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>This still looks different from the last tutorial. Which naturally tells us that not
            rendering with gamma correction before was actually a problem, as this version looks
            much better. The grey blends much better with the checkerboard, as the grey is now
            correctly halfway between white and black. The take-home point here is that ensuring
            linearity in all stages of the pipeline is always important. This includes mipmap
            generation.</p>

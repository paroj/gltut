        <p>This is fine for a 3-vertex example. But imagine a scene involving millions of
            vertices (and no, that's not an exaggeration for high-end applications). Moving objects
            this way means having to copy millions of vertices from the original vertex data, add an
            offset to each of them, and then upload that data to an OpenGL buffer object. And all of
            that is <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> rendering. Clearly there must be a better way; games
            can not possibly do this every frame and still hold decent framerates.</p>
        <p>Actually for quite some time, they did. In the pre-GeForce 256 days, that was how all
            games worked. Graphics hardware just took a list of vertices in clip space and rasterized them into fragments and pixels. Granted, in those days,
            we were talking about maybe 10,000 triangles per frame. And while CPUs have come a long
            way since then, they have not scaled with the complexity of graphics scenes.</p>
        <p>The GeForce 256 (note: not a GT 2xx card, but the very first GeForce card) was the
            first graphics card that actually did some from of vertex processing. It could store
            vertices in GPU memory, read them, do some kind of transformation on them, and then send
            them through the rest of the pipeline. The kinds of transformations that the old GeForce
            256 could do were quite useful, but fairly simple.</p>
        <p>Having the benefit of modern hardware and OpenGL 3.x, we have something far more
            flexible: vertex shaders.</p>
        <p>Remember what it is that we are doing. We compute an offset. Then we apply that offset
            to each vertex position. Vertex shaders are given each vertex position. So it makes
            sense to simply give the vertex shader the offset and let it compute the final vertex
            position, since it operates on each vertex. This is what
                <code class="filename">VertPositionOffset.cpp</code> does.</p>
        <p>The vertex shader is found in <code class="filename">data\positionOffset.vert</code>. The
            vertex shader used here is as follows:</p>
        <div class="example"><a name="idp2071"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.4. Offsetting Vertex Shader</b></p><div class="example-contents">
            
            <pre class="programlisting">#version 330

layout(location = 0) in vec4 position;
uniform vec2 offset;

void main()
{
    vec4 totalOffset = vec4(offset.x, offset.y, 0.0, 0.0);
    gl_Position = position + totalOffset;
}</pre>
        </div></div><br class="example-break">
        <p>After defining the input <code class="varname">position</code>, the shader defines a
            2-dimensional vector <code class="varname">offset</code>. But it defines it with the term
                <code class="literal">uniform</code>, rather than <code class="literal">in</code> or
                <code class="literal">out</code>. This has a particular meaning.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Shaders and Granularity. </b>
            Recall that, with each execution of a shader, the shader gets new values for
                variables defined as <code class="literal">in</code>. Each time a vertex shader is called, it
                gets a different set of inputs from the vertex attribute arrays and buffers. That is
                useful for vertex position data, but it is not what we want for the offset. We want
                each vertex to use the <span class="emphasis"><em>same</em></span> offset; a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">uniform</span>”</span>
                offset, if you will.
        </p>
        <p>Variables defined as <code class="literal">uniform</code> do not change at the same frequency as
            variables defined as <code class="literal">in</code>. Input variables change with every execution
            of the shader. Uniform variables (called <em class="glossterm">uniforms</em>) change only
            between executions of rendering calls. And even then, they only change when the user
            sets them explicitly to a new value. </p>
        <p>Vertex shader inputs come from vertex attribute array definitions and buffer objects.
            By contrast, uniforms are set directly on program objects.</p>
        <p>In order to set a uniform in a program, we need two things. The first is a uniform
            location. Much like with attributes, there is an index that refers to a specific uniform
            value. Unlike attributes, you cannot set this location yourself; you must query it. In
            this tutorial, this is done in the <code class="function">InitializeProgram</code> function, with
            this line:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">offsetLocation = glGetUniformLocation(theProgram, "offset");</pre>
        <p>The function <code class="function">glGetUniformLocation</code> retrieves the uniform location
            for the uniform named by the second parameter. Note that just because a uniform is
            defined in a shader, GLSL does not <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> to provide a location for
            it. It will only have a location if the uniform is actually used in the program, as we
            see in the vertex shader; <code class="function">glGetUniformLocation</code> will return -1 if
            the uniform has no location.</p>
        <p>Once we have the uniform location, we can set the uniform's value. However, unlike
            retrieving the uniform location, setting a uniform's value requires that the program be
            currently in use with <code class="function">glUseProgram</code>. Thus, the rendering code looks
            like this:</p>
        <div class="example"><a name="idp2100"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.5. Draw with Calculated Offsets</b></p><div class="example-contents">
            
            <pre class="programlisting">void display()
{
    float fXOffset = 0.0f, fYOffset = 0.0f;
    ComputePositionOffsets(fXOffset, fYOffset);
    
    glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    
    glUseProgram(theProgram);
    
    glUniform2f(offsetLocation, fXOffset, fYOffset);
    
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBufferObject);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
    glVertexAttribPointer(0, 4, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, 0);
    
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
    
    glDisableVertexAttribArray(0);
    glUseProgram(0);
    
    glutSwapBuffers();
    glutPostRedisplay();
}</pre>
        </div></div><br class="example-break">
        <p>We use <code class="function">ComputePositionOffsets</code> to get the offsets, and then use
                <code class="function">glUniform2f</code> to set the uniform's value. The buffer object's
            data is never changed; the shader simply does the hard work. Which is why those shader
            stages exist in the first place.</p>
        <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Standard OpenGL Nomenclature</b></p></div></div></div>
            
            <p>The function <code class="function">glUniform2f</code> uses a special bit of OpenGL
                nomenclature. Specifically, the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">2f</span>”</span> part.</p>
            <p>Uniforms can have different types. And because OpenGL is defined in terms of C
                rather than C++, there is no concept of function overloading. So functions that do
                the same thing which take different types must have different names. OpenGL has
                standardized its naming convention for these.</p>
            <p>Functions like <code class="function">glUniform</code> have a suffix. The first part of the
                suffix is the number of values it takes. In the above case,
                    <code class="function">glUniform2f</code> takes 2 values, in addition to the regular
                parameters. The basic <code class="function">glUniform</code> parameters are just the uniform
                location, so <code class="function">glUniform2f</code> takes a uniform location and two
                values.</p>
            <p>The type of values it takes is defined by the second part. The possible type names
                and their associated types are:</p>

            </div>
            <p>Note that OpenGL has special typedefs for all of these types. <span class="type">GLfloat</span>
                is a typedef for <span class="type">float</span>, for example. This is not particularly useful
                for simple types, but for integer types, they can be very useful.</p>
            <p>Not all functions that take multiple types take all possible types. For example,
                    <code class="function">glUniform</code> only comes in <code class="literal">i</code>,
                    <code class="literal">ui</code>, and <code class="literal">f</code> variations (OpenGL 4.0
                introduces <code class="literal">d</code> variants).</p>
            <p>There are also vector forms, defined by adding a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">v</span>”</span> after the type.
                These take an array of values, with a parameter saying how many elements are in the
                array. So the function <code class="function">glUniform2fv</code> takes a uniform location, a
                number of entries, and an array of that many entries. Each entry is <span class="emphasis"><em>two
                    floats</em></span> in size; the number of entries is not the number of floats or
                other types. It is the number of values divided by the number of values per entry.
                Since <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">2f</span>”</span> represents two floats, that is how many values are in each
                entry.</p>
            <p>Some OpenGL functions just take a type without a number. These functions take a
                fixed number of parameters of that type, usually just one.</p>

            <b>Vector Math. </b>
            You may be curious about how these lines work:
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">vec4 totalOffset = vec4(offset.x, offset.y, 0.0, 0.0);
gl_Position = position + totalOffset;</pre>
        <p>The <span class="type">vec4</span> that looks like a function here is a constructor; it creates a
                <span class="type">vec4</span> from 4 floats. This is done to make the addition easier.</p>
        <p>The addition of <code class="varname">position</code> to <code class="varname">totalOffset</code> is a
            component-wise addition. It is a shorthand way of doing this:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">gl_Position.x = position.x + totalOffset.x;
gl_Position.y = position.y + totalOffset.y;
gl_Position.z = position.z + totalOffset.z;
gl_Position.w = position.w + totalOffset.w;</pre>
        <p>GLSL has a lot of vector math built in. The math operations are all component-wise
            when applied to vectors. However, it is illegal to add vectors of different dimensions
            to each other. So you cannot have a <span class="type">vec2</span> + <span class="type">vec4</span>. That is why
            we had to convert <code class="varname">offset</code> to a vec4 before performing the
            addition.</p>

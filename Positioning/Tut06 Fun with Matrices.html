        <p>In all of the previous examples except for the translation one, we always combined the
            transformation with a translation operation. So the scale transform was not a pure scale
            transform; it was a scale and translate transformation matrix. The translation was there
            primarily so that we could see everything properly.</p>
        <p>But these are not the only combinations of transformations that can be performed.
            Indeed, any combination of transformation operations is possible; whether they are
            meaningful and useful depends on what you are doing.</p>
        <p>Successive transformations can be seen as doing successive multiplication operations.
            For example, if S is a pure scale matrix, T is a pure translation matrix, and R is a
            pure rotation matrix, then the shader can compute the result of a transformation as
            follows:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">vec4 temp;
temp = T * position;
temp = R * temp;
temp = S * temp;
gl_Position = cameraToClipMatrix * temp;</pre>
        <p>In mathematical terms, this would be the following series of matrix operations: 
                <span class="mathphrase">Final = C*S*R*T*position</span>
            , where C is the camera-to-clip space transformation matrix.</p>
        <p>This is functional, but not particularly flexible; the series of transforms is baked
            into the shader. It is also not particularly fast, what with having to do four
            vector/matrix multiplications for every vertex.</p>
        <p>Matrix math gives us an optimization. Matrix math is not commutative: 
                <span class="mathphrase">S*R</span>
             is not the same as 
                <span class="mathphrase">R*S</span>
            . However, it is <span class="emphasis"><em>associative</em></span>: 
                <span class="mathphrase">(S*R)*T</span>
             is the same as 
                <span class="mathphrase">S*(R*T)</span>
            . The usual grouping for vertex transformation is this: 
                <span class="mathphrase">Final = C*(S*(R*(T*position)))</span>
            . But this can easily be regrouped as: 
                <span class="mathphrase">Final = (((C*S)*R)*T)*position</span>
            .</p>
        <p>This would in fact be slower for the shader to compute, since full matrix-to-matrix
            multiplication is much slower than matrix-to-vector multiplication. But the combined
            matrix 
                <span class="mathphrase">(((C*S)*R)*T)</span>
             is <span class="emphasis"><em>fixed</em></span> for all of a given object's vertices.
            This can be computed on the CPU, and all we have to do is upload a single matrix to
            OpenGL. And since we're already uploading a matrix to OpenGL for each object we render,
            this changes nothing about the overall performance characteristics of the rendering (for
            the graphics hardware).</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>This</em></span> is one of the main reasons matrices are used. You can build
            an incredibly complex transformation sequence with dozens of component transformations.
            And yet, all it takes for the GPU to use this to transform positions is a single
            vector/matrix multiplication.</p>

            <p>As previously stated, matrix multiplication is not commutative. This means that
                the combined transform 
                    <span class="mathphrase">S*T</span>
                 is not the same as 
                    <span class="mathphrase">T*S</span>
                . Let us explore this further. This is what these two composite
                transform matrices look like:</p>

            </div></div><br class="figure-break">
            <p>If you think about the order of operations, this makes sense. Even though one can
                think of the combined transform 
                    <span class="mathphrase">S*T</span>
                 as a single transform, it is ultimately a composite operation. The
                transformation T happens first; the object is translated into a new position.</p>
            <p>What you must understand is that something special happens between S and T.
                Namely, that S is now being applied to positions that are not from model space (the
                space the original vertices were in), but are in <span class="emphasis"><em>post translation
                    space.</em></span> This is an intermediate coordinate system defined by T.
                Remember: a matrix, even a translation matrix, defines a full-fledged coordinate
                system.</p>
            <p>So S now acts on the T-space position of the vertices. T-space has an origin,
                which in T-space is (0, 0, 0). However, this origin back in model space is the
                translation part of the matrix T. A scaling transformation matrix performs scaling
                based on the origin point in the space of the vertices being scaled. So the scaling
                matrix S will scale the points away from the origin point in T-space. Since what you
                (probably) actually wanted was to scale the points away from the origin point in
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>model space</em></span>, S needs to come first.</p>
            <p>Orientation (rotation) matrices have the same issue. The orientation is always
                local to the origin in the current space of the positions. So a rotation matrix must
                happen before the translation matrix. Scales generally should happen before
                orientation; if they happen afterwards, then the scale will be relative to the
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> axis orientation, not the model-space one. This is fine
                if it is a uniform scale, but a non-uniform scale will be problematic.</p>
            <p>There are reasons to put a translation matrix first. If the model-space origin is
                not the point that you wish to rotate or scale around, then you will need to perform
                a translation first, so that the vertices are in the space you want to rotate from,
                then apply a scale or rotation. Doing this multiple times can allow you to scale and
                rotate about two completely different points.</p>

            <p>In more complex scenes, it is often desirable to specify the transform of one
                model relative to the model space transform of another model. This is useful if you
                want one object (object B) to pick up another object (object A). The object that
                gets picked up needs to follow the transform of the object that picked it up. So it
                is often easiest to specify the transform for object B relative to object A.</p>
            <p>A conceptually single model that is composed of multiple transforms for multiple
                rendered objects is called a <em class="glossterm">hierarchical model.</em> In such a
                hierarchy, the final transform for any of the component pieces is a sequence of all
                of the transforms of its parent transform, plus its own model space transform.
                Models in this transform have a parent-child relationship to other objects.</p>
            <p>For the purposes of this discussion, each complete transform for a model in the
                hierarchy will be called a <em class="glossterm">node.</em> Each node is defined by a
                specific series of transformations, which when combined yield the complete
                transformation matrix for that node. Usually, each node has a translation, rotation,
                and scale, though the specific transform can be entirely arbitrary. What matters is
                that the full transformation matrix is relative to the space of its parent, not
                camera space.</p>
            <p>So if you have a node who's translation is (3, 0, 4), then it will be 3 X-units
                and 4 Z-units from the origin of its parent transform. The node itself does not know
                or care what the parent transform actually is; it simply stores a transform relative
                to that.</p>
            <p>Technically, a node does not have to have a mesh. It is sometimes useful in a
                hierarchical model to have nodes that exist solely to position other, visible nodes.
                Or to act as key points for other purposes, such as identifying the position of the
                gun's muzzle to render a muzzle flash.</p>
            <p>The <span class="propername">Hierarchy</span> tutorial renders a hierarchical
                model of an arm. This tutorial is interactive; the relative angles of the nodes can
                be changed with keyboard commands. The angles are bound within certain values, so
                the model will stop bending once these values are exceeded. These commands are as
                follows:</p>

            <p>The program and VAO binding code should look familiar, but most of the code should
                be fairly foreign.</p>
            <p>The <code class="classname">MatrixStack</code> object created in the very first line is a
                class that is also a part of this project. It implements the concept of a
                    <em class="glossterm">matrix stack.</em> The matrix stack is a method for dealing
                with transformations in hierarchical models.</p>
            <p>A stack is a particular data structure concept. Stacks store a controlled sequence
                of objects. But unlike arrays, linked lists, or other general data structures, there
                are only 3 operations available to the user of a stack: push, pop, and peek. Push
                places a value on the top of the stack. Pop removes the value on the top of the
                stack, making the previous top the current top. And peek simply returns the current
                value at the top of the stack.</p>
            <p>A matrix stack is, for the most part, a stack where the values are 4x4
                transformation matrices. Matrix stacks do have a few differences from regular
                stacks. C++ has an object, <code class="classname">std::stack</code>, that implements the
                stack concept. <code class="classname">MatrixStack</code> is a wrapper around that object,
                providing additional matrix stack functionality.</p>
            <p>A matrix stack has a current matrix value. An initially constructed matrix stack
                has an identity matrix. There are a number of functions on the matrix stack that
                multiply the current matrix by a particular transformation matrix; the result
                becomes the new current matrix. For example, the
                    <code class="classname">MatrixStack::RotateX</code> function multiplies the current
                matrix by a rotation around the X axis by the given angle.</p>
            <p>The <code class="function">MatrixStack::Push</code> function takes the current matrix and
                pushes it onto the stack. The <code class="function">MatrixStack::Pop</code> function makes
                the current matrix whatever the top of the stack is, and removes the top from the
                stack. The effect of these is to allow you to save a matrix, modify the current
                matrix, and then restore the old one after you have finished using the modified one.
                And you can store an arbitrary number of matrices, all in a specific order. This is
                invaluable when dealing with a hierarchical model, as it allows you to iterate over
                each element in the model from root to the leaf nodes, preserving older transforms
                and recovering them as needed.</p>
            <p>In the <code class="function">Draw</code> code, the translation is applied to the stack
                first, followed by an X rotation based on the current angle. Note that the order of
                operations is <span class="emphasis"><em>backwards</em></span> from what we said previously. That's
                because the matrix stack looks at transforms backwards. When we said earlier that
                the rotation should be applied before the translation, that was with respect to the
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>position</em></span>. That is, the equation should be 
                    <span class="mathphrase">T*R*v</span>
                , where v is the position. What we meant was that R should be
                applied to v before T. This means that R comes to the right of T.</p>
            <p>Rather than applying matrices to vertices, we are applying matrices to each other.
                The matrix stack functions all perform right-multiplication; the new matrix being
                multiplied by the current is on the right side. The matrix stack starts with the
                identity matrix. To have it store T*R, you must first apply the T transform, which
                makes the current matrix the current matrix is I*T. Then you apply the R transform,
                making the current matrix I*T*R.</p>
            <p>Right-multiplication is necessary, as the whole point of using the matrix stack is
                so that we can start at the root of a hierarchical model and save each node's
                transform to the stack as we go from parent to child. That simply would not be
                possible if matrix stacks left-multiplied, since we would have to apply the child
                transforms before the parent ones.</p>
            <p>The next thing that happens is that the matrix is preserved by pushing it on the
                stack. After this, a translation and scale are applied to the matrix stack. The
                stack's current matrix is uploaded to the program, and a model is rendered. Then the
                matrix stack is popped, restoring the original transform. What is the purpose of
                this code?</p>
            <p>What we see here is a difference between the transforms that need to be propagated
                to child nodes, and the transforms necessary to properly position the model(s) for
                rendering this particular node. It is often useful to have source mesh data where
                the model space of the mesh is not the same space that our node transform
                requires.</p>
            <p>In our case, we do this because we know that all of our pieces are 3D rectangles.
                A 3D rectangle is really just a cube with scales and translations applied to them.
                The scale makes the cube into the proper size, and the translation positions the
                origin point for our model space.</p>
            <p>Rather than have this extra transform, we could have created 9 or so actual
                rectangle meshes, one for each rendered rectangle. However, this would have required
                more buffer object room and more vertex attribute changes when these were simply
                unnecessary. The vertex shader runs no slower this way; it's still just multiplying
                by matrices. And the minor CPU computation time is exactly that: minor.</p>
            <p>This concept is very useful, even though it is not commonly talked about to the
                point where it gets a special name. As we have seen, it allows easy model reuse, but
                it has other properties as well. For example, it can be good for data compression.
                There are ways to store values on the range [0, 1] or [-1, 1] in 16 or 8 bits,
                rather than 32-bit floating point values. If you can apply a simple
                scale+translation transform to go from this [-1, 1] space to the original space of
                the model, then you can cut your data in half (or less) with virtually no impact on
                visual quality.</p>
            <p>Each section of the code where it uses an extra transform happens between a
                    <code class="function">MatrixStack::Push</code> and
                <code class="function">MatrixStack::Pop</code>. This preserves the node's matrix, so that it
                may be used for rendering with other nodes.</p>
            <p>At the bottom of the base drawing function is a call to draw the upper arm. That
                function looks similar to this function: apply the model space matrix to the stack,
                push, apply a matrix, render, pop, call functions for child parts. All of the
                functions, to one degree or another, look like this. Indeed, they all looks similar
                enough that you could probably abstract this down into a very generalized form. And
                indeed, this is frequently done by scene graphs and the like. The major difference
                between the child functions and the root one is that this function has a push/pop
                wrapper around the entire thing. Though since the root creates a MatrixStack to
                begin with, this could be considered the equivalent.</p>
            <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Matrix Stack Conventions</b></p></div></div></div>
                
                <p>There are two possible conventions for matrix stack behavior. The caller could
                    be responsible for pushing and popping the matrix, or the callee (the function
                    being called) could be responsible for this. These are called caller-save and
                    callee-save.</p>
                <p>In caller-save, what it is saying is that a function that takes a matrix stack
                    should feel free to do whatever they want to the current matrix, as well as
                    push/pop as much as they want. However, the callee <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> not
                    pop more than they push, though this is a general requirement with any function
                    taking a matrix stack. After all, a stack does not report how many elements it
                    has, so you cannot know whether someone pushed anything at all.</p>
                <p>In callee-save, what the convention is saying is that a function must be
                    responsible for any changes it wants to make to the matrix stack. If it wants to
                    change the matrix stack, then it must push first and pop after using those
                    changes.</p>
                <p>Callee-save is probably a better convention to use. With caller-save, a
                    function that takes a matrix stack must be assumed to modify it (if it takes the
                    object as a non-const reference), so it will have to do a push/pop. Whereas with
                    callee-save, you only push/pop as you explicitly need: at the site where you are
                    modifying the matrix stack. It groups the code together better.</p>

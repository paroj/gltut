    <p>In this tutorial, we will look at how to deal with rendering multiple objects, as well as
        what happens when multiple objects overlap.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp3447"></a>Multiple Objects in OpenGL</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p>The first step in looking at what happens when objects overlap is to draw more than
            one object. This is an opportunity to talk about a concept that will be useful in the
            future.</p>
        <p>An object, in terms of what you draw, can be considered the results of a single
            drawing call. Thus, an object is the smallest series of triangles that you draw with a
            single set of program object state.</p>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp3451"></a>Vertex Array Objects</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>Up until now, every time we have attempted to draw anything, we needed to do
                certain setup work before the draw call. In particular, we have to do the following,
                for <span class="emphasis"><em>each</em></span> vertex attribute used by the vertex shader:</p>
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
                    <p>Use <code class="function">glEnableVertexAttribArray</code> to enable this
                        attribute.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>Use <code class="function">glBindBuffer</code>(<code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>)
                        to bind to the context the buffer object that contains the data for this
                        attribute.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>Use <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code> to define the format of the
                        data for the attribute within the buffer object previously bound to
                            <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>.</p>
                </li></ol></div>
            <p>The more attributes you have, the more work you need to do for each object. To
                alleviate this burden, OpenGL provides an object that stores all of the state needed
                for rendering: the <em class="glossterm">Vertex Array Object</em>
                    (<acronym class="acronym">VAO</acronym>).</p>
            <p>VAOs are created with the <code class="function">glGenVertexArray</code> function. This
                works like <code class="function">glGenBuffers</code> (and like most other OpenGL objects);
                you can create multiple objects with one call. As before, the objects are
                    <span class="type">GLuint</span>s.</p>
            <p>VAOs are bound to the context with <code class="function">glBindVertexArray</code>; this
                function does not take a target the way that <code class="function">glBindBuffer</code> does.
                It only takes the VAO to bind to the context.</p>
            <p>Once the VAO is bound, calls to certain functions change the data in the bound
                VAO. Technically, they <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> have changed the VAO's state; all
                of the prior tutorials have these lines in the initialization function:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">glGenVertexArrays(1, &amp;vao);
glBindVertexArray(vao);</pre>
            <p>This creates a single VAO, which contains the vertex array state that we have been
                setting. This means that we have been changing the state of a VAO in all of the
                tutorials. We just did not talk about it at the time.</p>
            <p>The following functions change VAO state. Therefore, if no VAO is bound to the
                context (if you call <code class="function">glBindVertexArray(0)</code> or you do not bind a
                VAO at all), all of these functions, except as noted, will fail.</p>
            <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
                    <p><code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>. Also
                            <code class="function">glVertexAttribIPointer</code>, but we have not talked about

            <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Buffer Binding and Attribute Association</b></p></div></div></div>
                
                <p>You may notice that
                        <code class="function">glBindBuffer</code>(<code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>) is not
                    on that list, even though it is part of the attribute setup for rendering. The
                    binding to <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> is not part of a VAO because the
                    association between a buffer object and a vertex attribute does
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> happen when you call
                        <code class="function">glBindBuffer</code>(<code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>). This
                    association happens when you call
                    <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>.</p>
                <p>When you call <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>, OpenGL takes
                    whatever buffer is <span class="emphasis"><em>at the moment of this call</em></span> bound to
                        <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> and associates it with the given vertex
                    attribute. Think of the <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding as a global
                    pointer that <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code> reads. So you are free
                    to bind whatever you want or nothing at all to
                        <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> making a <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>
                    call; it will affect <span class="emphasis"><em>nothing</em></span> in the final rendering. So
                    VAOs do store which buffer objects are associated with which attributes; but
                    they do not store the <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding itself.</p>
                <p>If you want to know why <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code> does not
                    simply take a buffer object rather than requiring this bind+call mechanism, it
                    is again because of legacy API cruft. When buffer objects were first introduced,
                    they were designed to impact the API as little as possible. So the old
                        <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code> simply changed its behavior
                    depending on whether something was bound to <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>
                    or not. Nowadays, since this function will fail if nothing is bound to
                        <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>, it is simply an annoyance.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This allows you to setup a VAO early on, during initialization, and then simply
                bind it and call a rendering function to draw your object. Be advised when using a
                VAO in this way: VAOs are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> immutable. Calling any of the
                above functions will change the data stored in the VAO.</p>

            <p>In the last tutorial, we drew a rectangular prism. If you looked carefully at the
                vertex data, you may have noticed that a lot of vertex data was frequently repeated.
                To draw one face of the cube, we were required to have 6 vertices; the two shared
                vertices (along the shared line between the two triangles) had to be in the buffer
                object twice.</p>
            <p>For a simple case like ours, this is only a minor increase in the size of the
                vertex data. The compact form of the vertex data could be 4 vertices per face, or 24
                vertices total, while the expanded version we used took 36 total vertices. However,
                when looking at real meshes, like human-like characters and so forth that have
                thousands if not millions of vertices, sharing vertices becomes a major benefit in
                both performance and memory size. Removing duplicate data can shrink the size of the
                vertex data by 2x or greater in many cases.</p>
            <p>In order to remove this extraneous data, we must perform <em class="glossterm">indexed
                    drawing</em>, rather than the <em class="glossterm">array drawing</em> we
                have been doing up until now. In an earlier tutorial, we defined glDrawArrays
                conceptually as the following pseudo-code:</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp3531"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 5.1. Draw Arrays Implementation</b></p><div class="example-contents">
                
                <pre class="programlisting">void glDrawArrays(GLenum type, GLint start, GLint count)
{
    for(GLint element = start; element &lt; start + count; element++)
    {
        VertexShader(positionAttribArray[element], colorAttribArray[element]);
    }
}</pre>
            </div></div><br class="example-break">
            <p>This defines how <em class="glossterm">array drawing</em> works. You start with a
                particular index into the buffers, defined by the <code class="varname">start</code>
                parameter, and proceed forward by <code class="varname">count</code> vertices.</p>
            <p>In order to share attribute data between multiple triangles, we need some way to
                random-access the attribute arrays, rather than sequentially accessing them. This is
                done with an <em class="glossterm">element array</em>, also known as an <em class="glossterm">index
                    array</em>.</p>
            <p>Let's assume you have the following attribute array data:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">  Position Array:  Pos0, Pos1, Pos2, Pos3
  Color Array:     Clr0, Clr1, Clr2, Clr3</pre>
            <p>You can use <code class="function">glDrawArrays</code> to render either the first 3
                vertices as a triangle, or the last 3 vertices as a triangle (using a
                    <code class="varname">start</code> of 1 and <code class="varname">count</code> of 3). However, with
                the right element array, you can render 4 triangles from just these 4
                vertices:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">  Element Array: 0, 1, 2,  0, 2, 3,  0, 3, 1,  1, 2, 3</pre>
            <p>This will cause OpenGL to generate the following sequence of vertices:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">  (Pos0, Clr0), (Pos1, Clr1), (Pos2, Clr2),
  (Pos0, Clr0), (Pos2, Clr2), (Pos3, Clr3),
  (Pos0, Clr0), (Pos3, Clr3), (Pos1, Clr1),
  (Pos1, Clr1), (Pos2, Clr2), (Pos3, Clr3),</pre>
            <p>12 vertices, which generate 4 triangles.</p>
            <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Multiple Attributes and Index Arrays</b></p></div></div></div>
                
                <p>There is only <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> element array, and the indices fetched
                    from the array are used for <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> attributes of the vertex
                    arrays. So you cannot have an element array for positions and a separate one for
                    colors; they all have to use the same element array.</p>
                <p>This means that there can and often will be some duplication within a
                    particular attribute array. For example, in order to have solid face colors, we
                    will still have to replicate the color for every position of that triangle. And
                    corner positions that are shared between two triangles that have different
                    colors will still have to be duplicated in different vertices.</p>
                <p>It turns out that, for most meshes, duplication of this sort is fairly rare.
                    Most meshes are smooth across their surface, so different attributes do not
                    generally pop from location to location. Shared edges typically use the same
                    attributes for both triangles along the edges. The simple cubes and the like
                    that we use are one of the few cases where a per-attribute index would have a
                    significant benefit.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Now that we understand how indexed drawing works, we need to know how to set it up
                in OpenGL. Indexed drawing requires two things: a properly-constructed element array
                and using a new drawing command to do the indexed drawing.</p>
            <p>Element arrays, as you might guess, are stored in buffer objects. They have a
                special buffer object binding point, <code class="literal">GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>. You
                can use this buffer binding point for normal maintenance of a buffer object
                (allocating memory with glBufferData, etc), just like
                    <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>. But it also has a special meaning to OpenGL:
                indexed drawing is only possible when a buffer object is bound to this binding
                point, and the element array comes from this buffer object.</p>
            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
                <p>All buffer objects in OpenGL are the same, regardless of what target they are
                    bound to; buffer objects can be bound to multiple targets. So it is perfectly
                    legal to use the same buffer object to store vertex attributes and element
                    arrays (and, FYI, any data for any other use of buffer objects that exists in
                    OpenGL). Obviously, the different data would be in separate regions of the
                    buffer.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In order to do indexed drawing, we must bind the buffer to
                    <code class="literal">GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> and then call
                    <code class="function">glDrawElements</code>.</p>
            <div class="funcsynopsis">
                <table border="0" class="funcprototype-table" summary="Function synopsis" style="cellspacing: 0; cellpadding: 0;"><tr><td><code class="funcdef">void <b class="fsfunc">glDrawElements</b>(</code></td><td>GLenum <var class="pdparam">mode</var>, </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>GLsizei <var class="pdparam">count</var>, </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>GLenum <var class="pdparam">type</var>, </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>GLsizeiptr <var class="pdparam">indices</var><code>)</code>;</td></tr></table><div class="funcprototype-spacer"> </div>
            </div>
            <p>The first parameter is the same as the first parameter of glDrawArrays. The
                    <em class="parameter"><code>count</code></em> parameter defines how many indices will be pulled
                from the element array. The <em class="parameter"><code>type</code></em> field defines what the basic
                type of the indices in the element array are. For example, if the indices are stored
                as 16-bit unsigned shorts (GLushort), then this field should be
                    <code class="literal">GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT</code>. This allows the user the freedom to use
                whatever size of index they want. <code class="literal">GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</code> and
                    <code class="literal">GL_UNSIGNED_INT</code> (32-bit) are also allowed; indices must be
                unsigned.</p>
            <p>The last parameter is the byte-offset into the element array at which the index
                data begins. Index data (and vertex data, for that matter) should always be aligned
                to its size. So if we are using 16-bit unsigned shorts for indices, then
                    <em class="parameter"><code>indices</code></em> should be an even number.</p>
            <p>This function can be defined by the following pseudo-code:</p>

            <p>The tutorial project <span class="propername">Overlap No Depth</span> uses VAOs
                to draw two separate objects. These objects are rendered using indexed drawing. The
                setup for this shows one way to have the attribute data for multiple objects stored
                in a single buffer.</p>
            <p>For this tutorial, we will be drawing two objects. They are both wedges, with the
                sharp end facing the viewer. The difference between them is that one is horizontal
                and the other is vertical on the screen.</p>
            <p>The shaders are essentially unchanged from before. We are using the perspective
                matrix shader from the last tutorial, with modifications to preserve the aspect
                ratio of the scene. The only difference is the pre-camera offset value; in this
                tutorial, it is a full 3D vector, which allows us to position each wedge in the
                scene.</p>
            <p>The initialization has changed, allowing us to create our VAOs once at start-up
                time, then use them to do the rendering. The initialization code is as
                follows:</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp3601"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 5.3. VAO Initialization</b></p><div class="example-contents">

    glGenVertexArrays(1, &amp;vaoObject1);
    glBindVertexArray(vaoObject1);

    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertexBufferObject);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);
    glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, 0);

    glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, indexBufferObject);
    
    glBindVertexArray(0);
    
    glGenVertexArrays(1, &amp;vaoObject2);
    glBindVertexArray(vaoObject2);
    
    size_t posDataOffset = sizeof(float) * 3 * (numberOfVertices/2);
    colorDataOffset += sizeof(float) * 4 * (numberOfVertices/2);

    //Use the same buffer object previously bound to GL_ARRAY_BUFFER.
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);

            <p>This code looks complicated, but it is really just the rendering code we have seen
                before. The offset computations for the <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>
                calls are more complex, due to having the data for 2 objects stored in a single
                buffer. But overall it is the same code.</p>
            <p>The code generates 2 VAOs, binds them, then sets their state. Recall that, while
                the <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding is not part of the VAOs state, the
                    <code class="literal">GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> part
                of that state. So these VAOs store the attribute array data and the element buffer
                data; everything necessary to render each object except for the actual drawing
                call.</p>
            <p>In this case, both objects use the same element buffer. However, since the element
                buffer binding is part of the VAO state, it <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be set into
                each VAO individually. Notice that we only set the
                    <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding once, but the
                    <code class="literal">GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> is set for each VAO.</p>
            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
                <p>If you look at the vertex position attribute in our array, we have a
                    3-component position vector. But the shader still uses a <span class="type">vec4</span>. This
                    works because OpenGL will fill in any missing vertex attribute components that
                    the shader looks for but the attribute array doesn't provide. It fills them in
                    with zeros, except for the fourth component, which is filled in with a
                    1.0.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Though the initialization code has been expanded, the rendering code is quite
                simple:</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp3618"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 5.4. VAO and Indexed Rendering Code</b></p><div class="example-contents">
                
                <pre class="programlisting">    glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    
    glUseProgram(theProgram);
    
    glBindVertexArray(vaoObject1);
    glUniform3f(offsetUniform, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, ARRAY_COUNT(indexData), GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, 0);
    
    glBindVertexArray(vaoObject2);
    glUniform3f(offsetUniform, 0.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f);
    glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, ARRAY_COUNT(indexData), GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, 0);
    
    glBindVertexArray(0);
    glUseProgram(0);
    
    glutSwapBuffers();
    glutPostRedisplay();</pre>
            </div></div><br class="example-break">
            <p>We bind a VAO, set its uniform data (in this case, to position the object
                properly), and then we draw it with a call to <code class="function">glDrawElements</code>.
                This step is repeated for the second object.</p>
            <p>Running this tutorial will show the following image:</p>

            </div></div><br class="figure-break">
            <p>The two objects are essentially flipped versions of the same one, a wedge. One
                object appears smaller than the other because it is farther away, in terms of its Z
                distance to the camera. We are using a perspective transform, so it make sense that
                more distant objects appear smaller. However, if the smaller object is behind the
                larger one, why is it rendered on top of the one in front?</p>
            <p>Before we solve this mystery, there is one minor issue we should cover
                first.</p>

        <p>If you recall back to the <a class="link" href="Tut04%20Perspective%20Projection.html" title="Perspective Projection">Perspective projection
                tutorial,</a> we choose to use some special hardware in the graphics chip to do
            the final division of the W coordinate, rather than doing the entire perspective
            projection ourselves in the vertex shader. At the time, it was promised that we would see why this is
            hardware functionality rather than something the shader does.</p>
        <p>Let us review the full math operation we are computing here:</p>

        <p><code class="literal">R</code> is the perspective projected position, P is the camera-space
            position, E<sub>z</sub> is the Z-position of the eye relative to the plane
            (assumed to be -1), and P<sub>z</sub> is the camera-space Z position.</p>
        <p>One question you should always ask when dealing with equations is this: can it divide
            by zero? And this equation certainly can; if the camera-space position of any vertex is
            ever exactly 0, then we have a problem.</p>
        <p>This is where clip-space comes in to save the day. See, until we actually
                <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> the divide, everything is fine. A 4-dimensional vector that
            will be divided by the fourth component but has not <span class="emphasis"><em>yet</em></span> is still
            valid, even if the fourth component is zero. This kind of coordinate system is called a
                <em class="glossterm">homogeneous coordinate system</em>. It is a way of talking about
            things that you could not talk about in a normal, 3D coordinate system. Like dividing by
            zero, which in visual terms refers to coordinates at infinity.</p>
        <p>This is all nice theory, but we still know that the clip-space positions need to be
            divided by their W coordinate. So how to we get around this problem?</p>
        <p>First, we know that a W of zero means that the camera-space Z position of the point
            was zero as well. We also know that this point <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> lie outside of
            the viable region for camera space. That is because of the camera Z range: camera zNear
                <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be strictly greater than zero. Thus any point with a
            camera Z value of 0 must be in front of the zNear, and therefore outside of the visible
            world.</p>
        <p>Since the vertex coordinate is not going to be visible anyway, why bother drawing it
            and dividing by that pesky 0? Well, because that vertex happens to be part of a
            triangle, and if part of the triangle is visible, we have to draw it.</p>
        <p>But we do not have to draw <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of it.</p>
        <p><em class="glossterm">Clipping</em> is the process of taking a triangle and breaking it up
            into smaller triangles, such that only the part of the original triangle that is within
            the viewable region remains. This may generate only one triangle, or it may generate
            multiple triangles.</p>
        <p>Any vertex attributes associated with that vertex are interpolated (based on the
            vertex shader's interpolation qualifiers) to determine the relative value of the
            post-clipping vertex.</p>
        <p>As you might have guessed, clipping happens in <span class="emphasis"><em>clip space</em></span>, not
            NDC space. Hence the name. Since clip-space is a homogeneous coordinate system, we do not
            have to worry about those pesky zeros. Unfortunately, because homogeneous spaces are not
            easy to draw, we cannot show you what it would look like. But we can show you what it
            would look like if you clipped in camera space, in 2D:</p>

        <p>To see the results of clipping in action, run the <span class="propername">Vertex
                Clipping</span> tutorial. It is the same as the one for depth buffering, except
            one object has been moved very close to the zNear plane. Close enough that part of it is
            beyond the zNear and therefore is not part of the viewable area:</p>

        <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>A Word on Clipping Performance</b></p></div></div></div>
            
            <p>We have phrased the discussion of clipping as a way to avoid dividing by zero for
                good reason. The OpenGL specification states that clipping must be done against all
                sides of the viewable region. And it certainly appears that way; if you move objects
                far enough away that they overlap with zFar, then you will not see the objects.</p>
            <p>You can also see apparent clipping with objects against the four sides of the view
                frustum. To see this, you would need to modify the viewport with
                    <code class="function">glViewport</code>, so that only part of the window is being
                rendered to. If you move objects to the edge of the viewport, you will find that
                part of them does not get rendered outside this region.</p>
            <p>So clipping is happening all the time?</p>
            <p>Of course not. Clipping takes triangles and breaks them into pieces using
                4-dimensional homogeneous mathematics. One triangle can be broken up into several;
                depending on the location of the triangle, you can get quite a few different pieces.
                The simple act of turning one triangle into several is hard and time
                consuming.</p>
            <p>So, if OpenGL states that this must happen, but supposedly OpenGL-compliant
                hardware does not do it, then what's going on?</p>
            <p>Consider this: if we had not told you just now that the hardware does not do
                clipping most of the time, could you tell? No. And that's the point: OpenGL
                specifies <span class="emphasis"><em>apparent</em></span> behavior; the spec does not care if you
                actually do vertex clipping or not. All the spec cares about is that the user cannot
                tell the difference in terms of the output.</p>
            <p>That's how hardware can get away with the early-z optimization mentioned before;
                the OpenGL spec says that the depth test must happen after the fragment program
                executes. But if the fragment shader does not modify the depth, then would you be
                able to tell the difference if it did the depth test before the fragment shader? No;
                if it passes, it would have passed either way, and the same goes for failing.</p>
            <p>Instead of clipping, the hardware usually just lets the triangles go through if
                part of the triangle is within the visible region. It generates fragments from those
                triangles, and if a fragment is outside of the visible window, it is discarded
                before any fragment processing takes place.</p>
            <p>Hardware usually cannot do this however, if any vertex of the triangle has a
                clip-space W &lt;= zero. In terms of a perspective projection, this means that part
                of the triangle is fully behind the eye, rather than just behind the camera zNear
                plane. In these cases, clipping is much more likely to happen.</p>
            <p>Even so, clipping only happens if the triangle is partially visible; a triangle
                that is entirely in front of the zNear plane is dropped entirely.</p>
            <p>In general, you should try to avoid rendering things that will clip against the
                eye plane (clip-space W &lt;= 0, or camera-space Z &gt;= 0). You do not need to be
                pedantic about it; long walls and the like are fine. But, particularly for low-end
                hardware, a lot of clipping can really kill performance.</p>

        <p>As useful as model and world space offsetting is, there is one more space that it
            might be useful to orient from. Camera-space.</p>
        <p>This is primarily useful in modelling applications, but it can have other applications
            as well. In such programs, as the user spins the camera around to different angles, the
            user may want to transform the object relative to the direction of the view.</p>
        <p>In order to understand the solution to doing this, let's frame the problem explicitly.
            We have positions (p) in model space. These positions will be transformed by a current
            model-to-world orientation (O), and then by a final camera matrix (C). Thus, our
            transform equation is 
                <span class="mathphrase">C*O*p</span>
            .</p>
        <p>We want to apply an orientation offset (R), which takes points in camera-space. If we
            wanted to apply this to the camera matrix, it would simply be multiplied by the camera
            matrix: 
                <span class="mathphrase">R*C*O*p</span>
            . That's nice and all, but we want to apply a transform to O, not to
            C.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we need to use our transforms to generate a new orientation offset (N),
            which will produce the same effect:</p>
        <div class="informalequation">
                <span class="mathphrase">C*N*O = R*C*O</span>
            </div>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp7154"></a>Inversion</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>In order to solve this, we need to introduce a new concept. Given a matrix M,
                there may be a matrix N such that 
                    <span class="mathphrase">MN = I</span>
                , where I is the identity matrix. If there is such a matrix, the
                matrix N is called the <em class="glossterm">inverse matrix</em> of M. The notation for
                the inverse matrix of M is M<sup>-1</sup>. The symbol
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><sup>-1</sup></span>”</span> does not mean to raise the
                matrix to the -1 power; it means to invert it.</p>
            <p>The matrix inverse can be analogized to the scalar multiplicative inverse (ie:
                reciprocal). The scalar multiplicative inverse of X is the number Y such that 
                    <span class="mathphrase">XY = 1</span>
                .</p>
            <p>In the case of the scalar inverse, this is very easy to solve for: 
                    <span class="mathphrase">Y = 1/X</span>
                . Easy though this may be, there are values of X for which there is
                no multiplicative inverse. OK, there's <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> such real value of
                X: 0.</p>
            <p>The case of the inverse matrix is much more complicated. Just as with the scalar
                inverse, there are matrices that have no inverse. Unlike the scalar case, there are
                a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of matrices with no inverse. Also, computing the inverse
                matrix is a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> more complicated than simply taking the
                reciprocal of a value.</p>
            <p>Most common transformation matrices do have an inverse. And for the basic
                transformation matrices, the inverse matrix is very easy to compute. For a pure
                rotation matrix, simply compute a new rotation matrix by negating the angle that the
                old one was generated with. For a translation matrix, negate the origin value in the
                matrix. For a scale matrix, take the reciprocal of the scale along each axis.</p>
            <p>To take the inverse of a sequence of matrices, you can take the inverse of each of
                the component matrices. But you have to do the matrix multiplication in
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>reverse</em></span> order. So if we have 
                    <span class="mathphrase">M = TRS</span>
                , then 
                    <span class="mathphrase">M<sup>-1</sup> =
                            S<sup>-1</sup>R<sup>-1</sup>T<sup>-1</sup></span>
                .</p>
            <p>Quaternions, like matrices, have a multiplicative inverse. The inverse of a pure
                rotation matrix, which quaternions represent, is a rotation about the same axis with
                the negative of the angle. For any angle θ, it is the case that 
                    <span class="mathphrase">sin(-θ) = -sin(θ)</span>
                . It is also the case that 
                    <span class="mathphrase">cos(-θ) = cos(θ)</span>
                . Since the vector part of a quaternion is built by multiplying the
                axis by the sine of the half-angle, and the scalar part is the cosine of the
                half-angle, the inverse of any quaternion is just the negation of the vector
                part.</p>
            <p>You can also infer this to mean that, if you negate the axis of rotation, you are
                effectively rotating about the old axis but negating the angle. Which is true, since
                the direction of the axis of rotation defines what direction the rotation angle
                moves the points in. Negate the axis's direction, and you're rotating in the
                opposite direction.</p>
            <p>In quaternion lingo, the inverse quaternion is more correctly called the
                    <em class="glossterm">conjugate quaternion.</em> We use the same inverse notation,
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><sup>-1</sup>,</span>”</span> to denote conjugate
                quaternions.</p>
            <p>Incidentally, the identity quaternion is a quaternion who's rotation angle is
                zero. The cosine of 0 is one, and the sine of 0 is zero, so the vector part of the
                identity quaternion is zero and the scalar part is one.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp7195"></a>Solution</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>Given our new knowledge of inverse matrices, we can solve our problem.</p>
            <div class="informalequation">
                    <span class="mathphrase">C*N*O = R*C*O</span>
                </div>
            <p>We can right-multiply both sides of this equation by the inverse transform of
                O.</p>
            <div class="informalequation">
                <span class="mathphrase">(C*N*O)*O<sup>-1</sup> =
                        (R*C*O)*O<sup>-1</sup></span>
            </div>
            <div class="informalequation">
                <span class="mathphrase">C*N*I = R*C*I</span>
            </div>
            <p>The I is the identity transform. From here, we can left-multiply both sides by the
                inverse transform of C:</p>
            <div class="informalequation">
                <span class="mathphrase">C<sup>-1</sup> *(C*N) =
                    C<sup>-1</sup>*(R*C)</span>
            </div>
            <div class="informalequation">
                <span class="mathphrase">N = C<sup>-1</sup>*(R*C)</span>
            </div>
            <p>Therefore, given an offset that is in camera space, we can generate the
                world-space equivalent by multiplying it between the camera and inverse camera
                transforms.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp7217"></a>Transformation Spaces</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>It turns out that this is a generalized operation. It can be used for much more
                than just orientation changes.</p>
            <p>Consider a scale operation. Scales apply along the main axes of their space. But
                if you want to scale something along a different axis, how do you do that?</p>
            <p>You rotate the object into a coordinate system where the axis you want to scale
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> one of the basis axes, perform your scale, then rotate
                it back with the inverse of the previous rotation.</p>
            <p>Effectively, what we are doing is transforming, not positions, but other
                transformation matrices into different spaces. A transformation matrix has some
                input space and defines an output space. If we want to apply that transformation in
                a different space, we perform this operation.</p>
            <p>The general form of this sequence is as follows. Suppose you have a transformation
                matrix T, which operates on points in a space called F. We have some positions in
                the space P. What we want is to create a matrix that applies T's transformation
                operation, except that it needs to operate on points in the space of P. Given a
                matrix M that transforms from P space to F space, that matrix is 
                    <span class="mathphrase">M<sup>-1</sup>*T*M</span>
                .</p>

            <p>Let's look at how this all works out in code, with the <span class="propername">Camera Relative</span> tutorial. This works very similarly to the last
                tutorial, but with a few differences.</p>
            <p>Since we are doing camera-relative rotation, we need to have an actual camera that
                can move independently of the world. So we incorporate our camera code from our
                world space into this one. As before, the <span class="keycap"><strong>I</strong></span> and <span class="keycap"><strong>K</strong></span>
                keys will move the camera up and down, relative to a center point. The
                    <span class="keycap"><strong>J</strong></span> and <span class="keycap"><strong>K</strong></span> keys will move the camera left and
                right around the center point. Holding <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span> with these keys will
                move the camera in smaller increments.</p>
            <p>The <span class="keycap"><strong>SpaceBar</strong></span> will toggle between three transforms: model-relative
                (yaw/pitch/roll-style), world-relative, and camera-relative.</p>
            <p>Our scene also includes a ground plane as a reference.</p>

                has not been seen elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The substantive changes were in the <code class="function">OffsetOrientation</code>

            <p>The change here is the addition of the camera-relative condition. To do this in

            <p>The conjugate quaternion is computed with GLM. Then, we simply multiply them with

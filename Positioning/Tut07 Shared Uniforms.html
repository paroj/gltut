        <p>The <span class="propername">World Space</span> example had a few annoyances in it.
            Of particular pain was the fact that, whenever the perspective projection matrix or the
            world-to-camera matrix changed, we had to change uniforms in 3 programs. They all used
            the same value; it seems strange that we should have to go through so much trouble to
            change these uniforms.</p>
        <p>Also, 3 programs is a relatively simple case. When dealing with real examples, the
            number of programs can get quite large.</p>
        <p>There is a way to share uniforms between programs. To do this, we use a buffer object
            to store uniform data, and then tell our programs to use this particular buffer object
            to find its uniform data. A buffer object that stores uniforms is commonly called a
                <em class="glossterm">uniform buffer object</em>.</p>
        <p>It is important to understand that there is nothing special about a uniform buffer.
            Any of the things you could do with a regular buffer object can be done with a uniform
            buffer object. You can bind it to the <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> and use it for
            vertex data, you can use it for indexed rendering with
                <code class="literal">GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>, and many other things that buffer
            objects can be used for. Now granted, that doesn't mean that you should, only that you
            can.</p>
        <p>The example <span class="propername">World with UBO</span> uses a uniform buffer
            object to store the camera and perspective matrices.</p>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp6355"></a>Uniform Blocks</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>This begins with how the vertex shaders are defined.</p>

            <p>The definition of <span class="type">GlobalMatrices</span> looks like a struct definition, but
                it is not. It defines a <em class="glossterm">uniform block</em>. A uniform block is a
                series of uniform definitions whose data is not stored in the program object, but
                instead must come from a uniform buffer.</p>
            <p>The name <span class="type">GlobalMatrices</span> is used to identify this particular uniform
                block. This block has two members, both of the of mat4 type. The order of the
                components in a uniform block is very important.</p>
            <p>Notices that nothing else needs to change in the vertex shader. The
                    <code class="varname">modelToWorldMatrix</code> is unchanged, and the use of the
                components of the uniform block do not even need to be scoped with the
                    <span class="type">GlobalMatrices</span> name.</p>
            <p>The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">layout(std140)</span>”</span> part modifies the definition of the uniform
                block. Specifically, it specifies the <em class="glossterm">uniform block
                layout</em>.</p>
            <p>Buffer objects are unformatted arrays of bytes. Therefore, something must
                determine how the shader interprets a uniform buffer object's contents. OpenGL
                itself defines this to a degree, but the layout qualifier modifies the
                definition.</p>
            <p>OpenGL is very clear about how each element within a uniform block is laid out.
                Floating-point values are just the C++ representation of floats, so you can copy
                them directly from objects like <span class="type">glm::vec4</span>.</p>
            <p>Matrices are slightly trickier due to the column-major vs. row-major issue. The
                    <code class="function">glUniformMatrix*</code> functions all had a parameter that defines
                what order the matrix data given to the function is in. Similarly, a
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">layout</span>”</span> qualifier can specify <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">row-major</span>”</span> or
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">column-major</span>”</span>; these tell OpenGL how the matrices are stored in
                the buffer object. The default is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">column-major,</span>”</span> and since GLM stores
                its matrices in column-major order, we can use the defaults.</p>
            <p>What OpenGL does not directly specify is the spacing <span class="emphasis"><em>between</em></span>
                elements in the uniform block. This allows different hardware to position elements
                where it is most efficient for them. Some shader hardware can place 2
                    <span class="type">vec3</span>'s directly adjacent to one another, so that they only take up
                6 floats. Other hardware cannot handle that, and must pad each <span class="type">vec3</span> out
                to 4 floats.</p>
            <p>Normally, this would mean that, in order to set any values into the buffer object,
                you would have to query the program object for the byte offsets for each element in
                the uniform block.</p>
            <p>However, by using the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">std140</span>”</span> layout, this is not necessary. The
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">std140</span>”</span> layout has an explicit layout specification set down by
                OpenGL itself. It is basically a kind of lowest-common-denominator among the various
                different kinds of graphics hardware. The upside is that it allows you to easily
                know what the layout is without having to query it from OpenGL. The downside is that
                some space-saving optimizations may not be possible on certain hardware.</p>
            <p>One additional feature of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">std140</span>”</span> is that the uniform block is
                sharable. Normally, OpenGL allows the GLSL compiler considerable leeway to make
                optimizations. In this instance, if a GLSL compiler detects that a uniform is unused
                in a program, it is allowed to mark it as unused.
                    <code class="function">glGetUniformLocation</code> will return -1. It's actually legal to
                set a value to a location that is -1, but no data will actually be set.</p>
            <p>If a uniform block is marked with the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">std140</span>”</span> layout, then the
                ability to disable uniforms in within that block is entirely removed. All uniforms
                must have storage, even if this particular program does not use them. This means
                that, as long as you declare the same uniforms in the same order within a block, the
                storage for that uniform block will have the same layout in <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span>
                program. This means that multiple different programs can use the same uniform
                buffer.</p>
            <p>The other two alternatives to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">std140</span>”</span> are <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">packed</span>”</span> and
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">shared</span>”</span>. The default, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">shared,</span>”</span> prevents the uniform
                optimization, thus allowing the block's uniform buffer data to be shared among
                multiple programs. However, the user must still query layout information about where
                each uniform is stored. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">packed</span>”</span> allows uniform optimization, so these
                blocks cannot be shared between programs at all.</p>
            <p>For our needs, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">std140</span>”</span> is sufficient. It's also a good first step in
                any implementation; moving to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">packed</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">shared</span>”</span> as
                needed should generally be done only as an optimization. The rules for the
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">std140</span>”</span> layout are spelled out explicitly in the OpenGL
                Specification.</p>

            <p>Uniforms inside a uniform block do not have individual uniform locations. After
                all, they do not have storage within a program object; their data comes from a buffer
                object.</p>
            <p>So instead of calling glGetUniformLocation, we have a new function.</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">data.globalUniformBlockIndex =
    glGetUniformBlockIndex(data.theProgram, "GlobalMatrices");</pre>
            <p>The function <code class="function">glGetUniformBlockIndex</code> takes a program object
                and the name of a uniform block. It returns a <em class="glossterm">uniform block
                    index</em> that is used to refer to this uniform block. This is similar
                to how a uniform location value is used to refer to a uniform, rather than directly
                using its string name.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp6414"></a>Uniform Buffer Creation</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>Now that the programs have a uniform block, we need to create a buffer object to
                store our uniforms in.</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp6417"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 7.11. Uniform Buffer Creation</b></p><div class="example-contents">
                
                <pre class="programlisting">glGenBuffers(1, &amp;g_GlobalMatricesUBO);
glBindBuffer(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, g_GlobalMatricesUBO);
glBufferData(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, sizeof(glm::mat4) * 2, NULL, GL_STREAM_DRAW);
glBindBuffer(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, 0);</pre>
            </div></div><br class="example-break">
            <p>For all intents and purposes, this is identical to the way we created other buffer
                objects. The only difference is the use of the <code class="literal">GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER</code>
                binding target.</p>
            <p>The <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> target has a specific meaning. When
                something is bound to that target, calling
                    <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code> will cause the buffer object bound to
                that target to become the source for that particular attribute, as defined by the
                function call. The <code class="literal">GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> target also has a
                meaning; it specifies where indices come from for indexed rendering. The element
                array binding is even stored as part of a VAO's data (recall that the array buffer
                binding is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> stored in the VAO).</p>
            <p><code class="literal">GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER</code> does not really have an intrinsic meaning
                like these other two. Having something bound to this binding means nothing as far as
                any other function of OpenGL is concerned. Oh, you can call buffer object functions
                on it, like glBufferData as above. But it does not have any other role to play in
                rendering. The main reason to use it is to preserve the contents of more useful
                binding points. It also communicates to someone reading your code that this buffer
                object is going to be used to store uniform data.</p>
            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
                <p>This is not entirely 100% correct. OpenGL is technically allowed to infer
                    something about your intended use of a buffer object based on what target you
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> use to bind it. So by allocating storage for this
                    buffer in <code class="literal">GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER</code>, we are signaling something to
                    OpenGL, which can change how it allocates storage for the buffer.</p>
                <p>However, OpenGL is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> allowed to make any behavioral
                    changes based on this. It is still legal to use a buffer allocated on the
                        <code class="literal">GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER</code> target as a
                        <code class="literal">GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> or in any other buffer object usage. It
                    just may not be as fast as you might want.</p>
            </div>
            <p>We know that the size of this buffer needs to be two <span class="type">glm::mat4</span>'s in
                size. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">std140</span>”</span> layout guarantees this. That and the size of
                    <span class="type">glm::mat4</span>, which just so happens to correspond to how large a GLSL
                    <span class="type">mat4</span> is when stored in a uniform buffer.</p>
            <p>The <code class="function">reshape</code> function is guaranteed to be called after our
                    <code class="function">init</code> function. That's why we can allocate this buffer
                without filling in a default matrix. The reshape function is as follows:</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp6445"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 7.12. UBO-based Perspective Matrix</b></p><div class="example-contents">

    glBindBuffer(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, g_GlobalMatricesUBO);
    glBufferSubData(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, 0, sizeof(glm::mat4), glm::value_ptr(persMatrix.Top()));

            <p>This function just uses <code class="function">glBufferSubData</code> to upload the matrix

            <p>Thus far, we have a uniform buffer object into which we store matrices. And we
                have a program that has a uniform block that needs a uniform buffer to get its
                uniforms for. Now, the final step is to create the association between the uniform
                block in the programs and the uniform buffer object itself.</p>
            <p>Your first thought might be that there would be a function like glUniformBuffer
                that takes a program, a uniform block index, and the uniform buffer to associate
                that block with. But this is not the case; attaching a uniform buffer to a program's
                block is more complicated. And this is a good thing if you think about it.</p>
            <p>It works like this. The OpenGL context (effectively a giant struct containing each
                piece of data used to render) has an array of <em class="glossterm">uniform buffer binding
                    points</em>. Buffer objects can be bound to each of these binding points.
                For each uniform block in a program, there is a reference, not to a buffer object,
                but to one of these uniform buffer binding points. This reference is just a
                numerical index: 0, 1, 2, etc.</p>
            <p>A diagram should make it clearer:</p>
            <div class="figure"><a name="idp6463"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 7.7. Uniform Buffer and Block Binding Points</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
                
                <div class="mediaobject"><img src="UBOContextBinding.svg" alt="Uniform Buffer and Block Binding Points"></div>
            </div></div><br class="figure-break">
            <p>The program object is given an index that represents one of the slots in the
                context. The uniform buffer is bound to one of those slots. Therefore, when you
                render with that program, the uniform buffer that is in the slot specified by the
                program will be where the program gets its uniform data from.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to use a uniform buffer, one first must tell the program object which
                binding point in the context to find the buffer. This association is made with the
                    <code class="function">glUniformBlockBinding</code> function.</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">glUniformBlockBinding(data.theProgram, data.globalUniformBlockIndex,
    g_iGlobalMatricesBindingIndex);</pre>
            <p>The first parameter is the program, the second is the uniform block index queried
                before. The third is the uniform buffer binding point that this block should
                use.</p>
            <p>After doing this for each program, the uniform buffer must be bound to that
                binding point. This is done with a new function,
                    <code class="function">glBindBufferRange</code>.</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">glBindBufferRange(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, g_iGlobalMatricesBindingIndex,
    g_GlobalMatricesUBO, 0, sizeof(glm::mat4) * 2);</pre>
            <p>This functions similarly to <code class="function">glBindBuffer</code>; in addition to
                binding the buffer to the <code class="literal">GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER</code> target, it also binds
                the buffer to the given uniform buffer binding point. Lastly, it provides an offset
                and range, the last two parameters. This allows you to put uniform data in arbitrary
                places in a buffer object. You could have the uniform data for
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>several</em></span> uniform blocks in several programs all in one
                buffer object. The range parameters would be how to say where that block's data
                begins and how big it is.</p>
            <p>The reason this is better than directly binding a buffer object to the program
                object can be seen in exactly where all of this happens. Both of these functions are
                called as part of initialization code. <code class="function">glUniformBlockBinding</code> is
                called right after creating the program, and similarly
                    <code class="function">glBindBufferRange</code> is called immediately after creating the
                buffer object. Neither one needs to ever be changed. Yes, we change the contents of
                the buffer object. But where it is bound never changes.</p>
            <p>The global constant <code class="varname">g_iGlobalMatricesBindingIndex</code> is, as the
                name suggests, global. By convention, all programs get their buffer data from this
                index. Because of this convention, if we wanted to use a different buffer, we would
                not have to update every program that needs to use that buffer. Sure, for one or two
                programs, that would be a simple operation. But real applications can have hundreds
                of programs. Being able to establish this kind of convention makes using uniform
                buffer objects much easier than if they were directly associated with
                programs.</p>

            <p>In the <span class="propername">World Space</span> example, we drew the
                camera's look-at target directly in camera space, bypassing the world-to-camera
                matrix. Doing that with uniform buffers would be harder, since we would have to set
                the uniform buffer value twice in the same draw call. This is not particularly
                difficult, but it could be a drain on performance.</p>
            <p>Instead, we just use the camera's target position to compute a model-to-world
                matrix that always positions the object at the target point.</p>

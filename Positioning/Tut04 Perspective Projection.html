        <p>Recall that our destination image, the screen, is just a two dimensional array of
            pixels. The 3D rendering pipeline we are using defines transformations of vertex
            positions that go from clip-space to window space. Once the positions are in window
            space, 2D triangles are rendered.</p>
        <p>A <em class="glossterm">projection</em>, in terms of the rendering pipeline is a way to
            transform a world from one dimensionality to another. Our initial world is three
            dimensional, and therefore, the rendering pipeline defines a projection from this 3D
            world into the 2D one that we see. It is the 2D world in which the triangles are
            actually rendered.</p>
        <p>Finite projections, which are the ones we are interested in, only project objects onto
            a finite space of the lower dimensionality. For a 3D-to-2D projection, there is a finite
            plane on which the world is projected. For 2D to 1D, there is a bounded line that is the
            result of the projection.</p>
        <p>An <em class="glossterm">orthographic projection</em> is a very simplistic projection.
            When projecting onto an axis-aligned surface, as below, the projection simply involves
            throwing away the coordinate perpendicular to the surface.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp2455"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 4.3. 2D to 1D Orthographic Projection</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

            <div class="caption">
                <p>A scene orthographically projected onto the black line. The gray box
                    represents the part of the world that is visible to the projection; parts of the
                    scene outside of this region are not seen.</p>
            </div>
        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>When projecting onto an arbitrary line, the math is a bit more complicated. But what
            makes it an orthographic projection is that the dimension perpendicular to the surface
            is negated uniformly to create the projection. The fact that it is a projection in the
            direction of the perpendicular and that it is uniform is what makes it
            orthographic.</p>
        <p>Human eyes do not see the world via orthographic projection. If they did, you would
            only be able to see an area of the world the size of your pupils. Because we do not use
            orthographic projections to see (among other reasons), orthographic projections do not look
            particularly real to us.</p>
        <p>Instead, we use a pinhole camera model for our eyesight. This model performs a
                <em class="glossterm">perspective projection</em>. A perspective projection is a
            projection of the world on a surface as though seen through a single point. A 2D to 1D
            perspective projection looks like this:</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp2466"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 4.4. 2D to 1D Perspective Projection</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="Persp2DProjection.svg" alt="2D to 1D Perspective Projection"></div>
        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>As you can see, the projection is radial, based on the location of a particular point.
            That point is the eye or camera of the projection.</p>
        <p>Just from the shape of the projection, we can see that the perspective projection
            causes a larger field of geometry to be projected onto the surface. An orthographic
            projection only captures the rectangular prism directly in front of the surface of
            projection. A perspective projection captures a larger space of the world.</p>
        <p>In 2D, the shape of the perspective projection is a regular trapezoid (a quadrilateral
            that has only one pair of parallel sides, and the other pair of sides have the same
            slope). In 3D, the shape is called a <em class="glossterm">frustum</em>; essentially, a
            pyramid with the tip chopped off.</p>

            <p>Now that we know what we want to do, we just need to know how to do it.</p>
            <p>We will be making a few simplifying assumptions:</p>
            <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
                    <p>The plane of projection is axis-aligned and faces down the -Z axis. Thus,
                        -Z is farther away from the plane of projection.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>The eye point is fixed at the origin (0, 0, 0).</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>The size of the plane of projection will be [-1, 1]. All points that
                        project outside of this range are not drawn.</p>
                </li></ul></div>
            <p>Yes, this sounds somewhat like normalized device coordinate space. No, that's not
                a coincidence. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
            <p>We know a few things about how the projection results will work. A perspective
                projection essentially shifts vertices towards the eye, based on the location of
                that particular vertex. Vertices farther in Z from the front of the projection are
                shifted less than those closer to the eye. And the shift also depends on how far the
                vertices are from the center of the plane of projection, in the X,Y
                direction.</p>
            <p>The problem is really just a simple geometry problem. Here is the equivalent form
                in a 2D to 1D perspective projection.</p>

            <p>Since this is a vectorized function, this solution applies equally to 2D as to 3D.
                Thus, perspective projection is simply the task of applying that simple formula to
                every vertex that the vertex shader receives.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp2528"></a>The Perspective Divide</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>The basic perspective projection function is simple. Really simple. Indeed, it is
                so simple that it has been built into graphics hardware since the days of the
                earliest 3Dfx card and even prior graphics hardware.</p>
            <p>You might notice that the scaling can be expressed as a division operation
                (multiplying by the reciprocal). And you may recall that the difference between clip
                space and normalized device coordinate space is a division by the W coordinate. So
                instead of doing the divide in the shader, we can simply set the W coordinate of
                each vertex correctly and let the hardware handle it.</p>
            <p>This step, the conversion from clip-space to normalized device coordinate space,
                has a particular name: the <em class="glossterm">perspective divide</em>. So named
                because it is usually used for perspective projections; orthographic projections
                tend to have the W coordinates be 1.0, thus making the perspective divide a
                no-op.</p>
            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
                <p>You may be wondering why this arbitrary division-by-W step exists. You may
                    also be wondering, in this modern day of vertex shaders that can do vector
                    divisions very quickly, why we should bother to use the hardware division-by-W
                    step at all. There are several reasons. One we will cover in just a bit when we deal
                    with matrices. More important ones will be covered in future tutorials. Suffice it to
                    say that there are very good reasons to put the perspective term in the W
                    coordinate of clip space vertices.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp2536"></a>Camera Perspective</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>Before we can actually implement perspective projection, we need to deal with a
                new issue. The orthographic projection transform was essentially a no-op. It is
                automatic, by the nature of how OpenGL uses the clip space vertices output by the
                vertex shader. The perspective projection transform is a bit more involved. Indeed,
                it fundamentally changes the nature of the world.</p>
            <p>Our vertex positions before now have been stored directly in clip space. We did on
                occasion add an offset to the positions to move them to more convenient locations.
                But for all intents and purposes, the position values stored in the buffer object
                are exactly what our vertex shader outputs: clip space positions.</p>
            <p>Recall that the divide-by-W is part of the OpenGL-defined transform from clip
                space positions to NDC positions. Perspective projection defines a process for
                transforming positions <span class="emphasis"><em>into</em></span> clip space, such that these clip
                space positions will appear to be a perspective projection of a 3D world. This
                transformation has well-defined outputs: clip space positions. But what exactly are
                its <span class="emphasis"><em>input</em></span> values?</p>
            <p>We therefore define a new space for positions; let us call this space
                    <em class="glossterm">camera space.</em><a href="#ftn.idp2545" class="footnote" name="idp2545"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a> This is not a space that OpenGL recognizes (unlike clip-space which is
                explicitly defined by GL); it is purely an arbitrary user construction. The
                definition of camera space will affect the exact process of perspective projection,
                since that projection must produce proper clip space positions. Therefore, it can be
                useful to define camera space based on what we know of the general process of
                perspective projection. This minimizes the differences between camera space and the
                perspective form of clip space, and it can simplify our perspective projection
                logic.</p>
            <p>The volume of camera space will range from positive infinity to negative infinity
                in all directions. Positive X extends right, positive Y extends up, and positive Z
                is <span class="emphasis"><em>forward</em></span>. The last one is a change from clip space, where
                positive Z is away.</p>
            <p>Our perspective projection transform will be specific to this space. As previously
                stated, the projection plane shall be a region [-1, 1] in the X and Y axes, and at a
                Z value of -1. The projection will be from vertices in the -Z direction onto this
                plane; vertices that have a positive Z value are behind the projection plane.</p>
            <p>Now, we will make one more simplifying assumption: the location of the center of
                the perspective plane is fixed at (0, 0, -1) in camera space. Therefore, since the
                projection plane is pointing down the -Z axis, the eye's location relative to the plane
                of projection is (0, 0, -1). Thus, the E<sub>z</sub> value, the offset
                from the projection plane to the eye, is always -1. This means that our perspective
                term, when phrased as division rather than multiplication, is simply
                    P<sub>z</sub>/-1: the negation of the camera-space Z
                coordinate.</p>
            <p>Having a fixed eye position and projection plane makes it difficult to have
                zoom-in/zoom-out style effects. This would normally be done by moving the plane
                relative to the fixed eye point. There is a way to do this, however. All you need to
                do is, when transforming from camera space to clip space, scale all of the X and Y
                values by a constant. What this does is make the world, as the camera sees it,
                smaller or larger in the X and Y axes. It effectively makes the frustum wider or
                narrower.</p>
            <p>To compare, camera space and normalized device coordinate space (after the
                perspective divide) look like this, using a 2D version of a perspective
                projection:</p>
            <div class="figure"><a name="idp2556"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 4.7. Camera to NDC Transformation in 2D</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
                
                <div class="mediaobject"><img src="CameraToPerspective.svg" alt="Camera to NDC Transformation in 2D"></div>
            </div></div><br class="figure-break">
            <p>Do note that this diagram has the Z axis flipped from camera space and normalized
                device coordinate (NDC) space. This is because camera space and NDC space have
                different viewing directions. In camera space, the camera looks down the -Z axis;
                more negative Z values are farther away. In NDC space, the camera looks down the +Z
                axis; more positive Z values are farther away. The diagram flips the axis so that
                the viewing direction can remain the same between the two images (up is
                away).</p>
            <p>If you perform an orthographic projection from NDC space on the right (by dropping
                the Z coordinate), then what you get is a perspective projection of the world on the
                left. In effect, what we have done is transform objects into a three-dimensional
                space from which an orthographic projection will look like a perspective one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp2563"></a>Perspective in Depth</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>So we know what to do with the X and Y coordinates. But what does the Z value mean
                in a perspective projection?</p>
            <p>Until the next tutorial, we are going to ignore the <span class="emphasis"><em>meaning</em></span>
                of Z. Even so, we still need some kind of transform for it; if a vertex extends
                outside of the [-1, 1] box in any axis in normalized device coordinate (NDC) space,
                then it is outside of the viewing area. And because the Z coordinate undergoes the
                perspective divide just like the X and Y coordinates, we need to take this into
                account if we actually want to see anything in our projection.</p>
            <p>Our W coordinate will be based on the camera-space Z coordinate. We need to map Z
                values from the camera-space range [0, -∞) to the NDC space range [-1, 1]. Since
                camera space is an infinite range and we're trying to map to a finite range, we need
                to do some range bounding. The frustum is already finitely bound in the X and Y
                directions; we simply need to add a Z boundary.</p>
            <p>The maximum distance that a vertex can be before it is considered no longer in
                view is the <em class="glossterm">camera zFar</em>. We also have a minimum distance from
                the eye; this is called the <em class="glossterm">camera zNear</em>. This creates a
                finite frustum for our camera space viewpoint.</p>
            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
                <p>It is very important to remember that these are the zNear and zFar for the
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>camera</em></span> space. The next tutorial will also introduce a
                    range of depth, also using the names zNear and zFar. This is a related but
                    fundamentally different range.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The camera zNear can appear to effectively determine the offset between the eye
                and the projection plane. However, this is not the case. Even if zNear is less than
                1, which would place the near Z plane <span class="emphasis"><em>behind</em></span> the projection
                plane, you still get an effectively valid projection. Objects behind the plane can
                be projected onto the plane just as well as those in front of it; it is still a
                perspective projection. Mathematically, this works.</p>
            <p>What it does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> do is what you would expect if you moved the
                plane of projection. Since the plane of projection has a fixed size (the range [-1,
                1]), moving the plane would alter where points appear in the projection. Changing
                the camera zNear does not affect the X, Y position of points in the
                projection.</p>
            <p>There are several ways to go about mapping one finite range to another. One
                confounding problem is the perspective divide itself; it is easy to perform a linear
                mapping between two finite spaces. It is quite another to do a mapping that remains
                linear <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> the perspective divide. Since we will be dividing
                by -Z itself (the camera-space Z, not the clip-space Z), the math is much more
                complex than you might expect.</p>
            <p>For reasons that will be better explained in the next tutorial, we will use this
                modestly complicated function to compute the clip-space Z:</p>

            <p>Some important things about this equation and camera zNear/zFar. First, these
                values are <span class="emphasis"><em>positive</em></span>; the equation accounts for this when
                performing the transformation. Also, zNear <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> be 0; it can
                be very close to zero, but it must never be exactly zero.</p>
            <p>Let us review the previous diagram of camera-to-NDC transformation in 2D
                space:</p>
            <div class="informalfigure">
                <div class="mediaobject"><img src="CameraToPerspective.svg"></div>
            </div>
            <p>The example of 2D camera-space vs. 2D NDC space uses this equation to compute the
                Z values. Take a careful look at how the Z coordinates match. The Z distances are
                evenly spaced in camera space, but in NDC space, they are non-linearly distributed.
                And yet simultaneously, points that are colinear in camera-space remain colinear in
                NDC space.</p>
            <p>This fact has some interesting properties that we will investigate further in the
                next tutorial.</p>

            <p>Given all of the above, we now have a specific sequence of steps to transform a
                vertex from camera space to clip space. These steps are as follows:</p>
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
                    <p>Frustum adjustment: multiply the X and Y value of the camera-space

                    <p>Depth adjustment: modify the Z value from camera space to clip space, as

            <p>Now that we have all the theory down, we are ready to put things properly in
                perspective. This is done in the <span class="propername">ShaderPerspective</span> tutorial.</p>
            <p>Our new vertex shader, <code class="filename">data\ManualPerspective.vert</code> looks like

    gl_Position = clipPos;

}</pre>
            </div></div><br class="example-break">
            <p>We have a few new uniforms, but the code itself is only modestly complex.</p>
            <p>The first statement simply applies an offset, just like the vertex shaders we have
                seen before. It positions the object in camera space, so that it is offset from the
                center of the view. This is here to make it easier to position the object for
                projection.</p>
            <p>The next statement performs a scalar multiply of the camera-space X and Y
                positions, storing them in a temporary 4-dimensional vector. From there, we compute
                the clip Z position based on the formula discussed earlier.</p>
            <p>The W coordinate of the clip space position is the Z distance in camera space
                divided by the Z distance from the plane (at the origin) to the eye. The eye is
                fixed at (0, 0, -1), so this leaves us with the negation of the camera space Z
                position. OpenGL will automatically perform the division for us.</p>
            <p>After that, we simply store the clip space position where OpenGL needs it, store
                the color, and we're done. The fragment shader is unchanged.</p>
            <p>With all of the new uniforms, our program initialization routine has
                changed:</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp2667"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 4.3. Program Initialization</b></p><div class="example-contents">
                
                <pre class="programlisting">offsetUniform = glGetUniformLocation(theProgram, "offset");

frustumScaleUnif = glGetUniformLocation(theProgram, "frustumScale");
zNearUnif = glGetUniformLocation(theProgram, "zNear");
zFarUnif = glGetUniformLocation(theProgram, "zFar");

glUseProgram(theProgram);
glUniform1f(frustumScaleUnif, 1.0f);
glUniform1f(zNearUnif, 1.0f);
glUniform1f(zFarUnif, 3.0f);
glUseProgram(0);</pre>
            </div></div><br class="example-break">
            <p>We only set the new uniforms once. The scale of 1.0 means effectively no change.
                We define the Z to go from -1 to -3 (remember that, in our Z equation, the zNear and
                zFar are positive but refer to negative values).</p>
            <p>The location of the prism has also changed. In the original tutorial, it was
                located on the 0.75 range in Z. Because camera space has a very different Z from
                clip space, this had to change. Now, the Z location of the prism is between -1.25
                and -2.75.</p>
            <p>All of this leaves us with this result:</p>

            <p>We glossed over something in the vertex shader that bears more discussion. Namely,
                this line:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">clipPos.xy = cameraPos.xy * frustumScale;</pre>
            <p>Even if you are familiar with vector math libraries in other languages, this code
                should be rather odd. Traditional vector libraries allow you to write selectors like
                    <code class="literal">vec.x</code> and <code class="literal">vec.w</code> in order to get a specific
                field from a vector. So what does something like <code class="literal">vec.xy</code>
                mean?</p>
            <p>Well, it means the obvious; this expression returns a 2D vector
                (<span class="type">vec2</span>), since there are only two components mentioned (X and Y). This
                vector will have its first component come from the X component of
                    <code class="varname">vec</code> and the second component come from the Y component of
                    <code class="varname">vec</code>. This kind of selection is called, in GLSL parlance,
                    <em class="glossterm">swizzle selection.</em> The size of the returned vector will
                be the number of components you mention, and the order of these components will
                dictate the order of the components returned.</p>
            <p>You can do any kind of swizzle operation on a vector, so long as you keep in mind
                the following rules:</p>
            <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
                    <p>You cannot select components that are not in the source vector. So if you
                        have:</p>
                    <pre class="programlisting">vec2 theVec;</pre>
                    <p>You cannot do <code class="literal">theVec.zz</code> because it has no Z component.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>You cannot select more than 4 components.</p>
                </li></ul></div>
            <p>These are the only rules. So you can have a <span class="type">vec2</span> that you swizzle to
                create a <span class="type">vec4</span> (<code class="literal">vec.yyyx</code>); you can repeat components;
                etc. Anything goes so long as you stick to those rules.</p>
            <p>You should also assume that swizzling is fast. This is not true of most CPU-based
                vector hardware, but since the earliest days of programmable GPUs, swizzle selection
                has been a prominent feature. In the early programmable days, swizzles caused
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> performance loss; in all likelihood, this has not
                changed.</p>
            <p>Swizzle selection can also be used on the left side of the equals, as we have done
                here. It allows you to set specific components of a vector without changing the
                other components.</p>
            <p>When you multiply a vector by a scalar (non-vector value), it does a
                component-wise multiply, returning a vector containing the scalar multiplied by each
                of the components of the vector. We could have written the above line as
                follows:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">clipPos.x = cameraPos.x * frustumScale;
clipPos.y = cameraPos.y * frustumScale;</pre>
            <p>But it probably would not be as fast as the swizzle and vector math version.</p>

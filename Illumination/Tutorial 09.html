    <p>It is always best to start simply. And since lighting is a big topic, we will begin with
        the simplest possible scenario.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp7402"></a>Modelling Lights</h2></div></div></div>
        
        
        <p>Lighting is complicated. Very complicated. The interaction between a surface and a
            light is mostly well understood in terms of the physics. But actually doing the
            computations for full light/surface interaction as it is currently understood is
            prohibitively expensive.</p>
        <p>As such, all lighting in any real-time application is some form of approximation of
            the real world. How accurate that approximation is generally determines how close to
                <em class="glossterm">photorealism</em> one gets. Photorealism is the ability to render
            a scene that is indistinguishable from a photograph of reality.</p>
        <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Non-Photorealistic Rendering</h3>
            
            <p>There are lighting models that do not attempt to model reality. These are, as a
                group, called non-photorealistic rendering (<acronym class="acronym">NPR</acronym>) techniques.
                These lighting models and rendering techniques can attempt to model cartoon styles
                (typically called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cel shading</span>”</span>), paintbrush effects, pencil-sketch, or
                other similar things. NPR techniques include lighting models, but they also do
                other, non-lighting things, like drawing object silhouettes in a dark, ink-like
                color.</p>
            <p>Developing good NPR techniques is at least as difficult as developing good
                photorealistic lighting models. For the most part, in this book, we will focus on
                approximating photorealism.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A <em class="glossterm">lighting model</em> is an algorithm, a mathematical function, that
            determines how a surface interacts with light.</p>
        <p>In the real world, our eyes see by detecting light that hits them. The structure of
            our iris and lenses use a number of photorecepters (light-sensitive cells) to resolve a
            pair of images. The light we see can have one of two sources. A light emitting object
            like the sun or a lamp can emit light that is directly captured by our eyes. Or a
            surface can reflect light from another source that is captured by our eyes. Light
            emitting objects are called <em class="glossterm">light sources.</em></p>
        <p>The interaction between a light and a surface is the most important part of a lighting
            model. It is also the most difficult to get right. The way light interacts with atoms on
            a surface alone involves complicated quantum mechanical principles that are difficult to
            understand. And even that does not get into the fact that surfaces are not perfectly
            smooth or perfectly opaque.</p>
        <p>This is made more complicated by the fact that light itself is not one thing. There is
            no such thing as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">white light.</span>”</span> Virtually all light is made up of a number
            of different wavelengths. Each wavelength (in the visible spectrum) represents a color.
            White light is made of many wavelengths (colors) of light. Colored light simply has
            fewer wavelengths in it than pure white light.</p>
        <p>Surfaces interact with light of different wavelengths in different ways. As a
            simplification of this complex interaction, we will assume that a surface can do one of
            two things: absorb that wavelength of light or reflect it.</p>
        <p>A surface looks blue under white light because the surface absorbs all non-blue parts
            of the light and only reflects the blue parts. If one were to shine a red light on the
            surface, the surface would appear very dark, as the surface absorbs non-blue light, and
            the red light does not have much blue light in it.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp7422"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.1. Surface Light Absorption</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="SurfaceColorAbsorption.svg" alt="Surface Light Absorption"></div>
        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>Therefore, the apparent color of a surface is a combination of the absorbing
            characteristics of the surface (which wavelengths are absorbed or reflected) and the
            wavelengths of light shone upon that surface.</p>
        <p>The very first approximation that is made is that not all of these wavelengths matter.
            Instead of tracking millions of wavelengths in the visible spectrum, we will instead
            track 3. Red, green, and blue.</p>
        <p>The RGB intensity of light reflected from a surface at a particular point is a
            combination of the RGB light absorbing characteristics of the surface at that point and
            the RGB <em class="glossterm">light intensity</em> shone on that point on the surface. All
            of these, the reflected light, the source light, and the surface absorption, can be
            described as RGB colors, on the range [0, 1].</p>
        <p>The intensity of light shone upon a surface depends on (at least) two things. First,
            it depends on the intensity of light that reaches the surface from a light source. And
            second, it depends on the angle between the surface and the light.</p>
        <p>Consider a perfectly flat surface. If you shine a column of light with a known
            intensity directly onto that surface, the intensity of that light at each point under
            the surface will be a known value, based on the intensity of the light divided by the
            area projected on the surface.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp7433"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.2. Perpendicular Light</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="DirectLightColumn.svg" alt="Perpendicular Light"></div>
        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>If the light is shone instead at an angle, the area on the surface is much wider. This
            spreads the same light intensity over a larger area of the surface; as a result, each
            point under the light <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">sees</span>”</span> the light less intensely.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="idp7440"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.3. Light at an Angle</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="AngleLightColumn.svg" alt="Light at an Angle"></div>
        </div></div><br class="figure-break">
        <p>Therefore, the intensity of the light cast upon a surface is a function of the
            original light's intensity and the angle between the surface and the light source. This
            angle is called the <em class="glossterm">angle of incidence</em> of the light.</p>
        <p>A lighting model is a function of all of these parameters. This is far from a
            comprehensive list of lighting parameters; this list will be expanded considerably in
            future discussions.</p>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp7448"></a>Standard Diffuse Lighting</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p><em class="glossterm">Diffuse lighting</em> refers to a particular kind of
                light/surface interaction, where the light from the light source reflects from the
                surface at many angles, instead of as a perfect mirror.</p>
            <div class="figure"><a name="idp7452"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.4. Diffuse Reflectance</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

            <p>An ideal diffuse material will reflect light evenly in all directions, as shown in
                the picture above. No actual surfaces are ideal diffuse materials, but this is a
                good starting point and looks pretty decent.</p>
            <p>For this tutorial, we will be using the <em class="glossterm">Lambertian
                    reflectance</em> model of diffuse lighting. It represents the ideal case
                shown above, where light is reflected in all directions equally. The equation for
                this lighting model is quite simple:</p>

                cosine of this angle will be 1.0. The lighting will be at its brightest. When the
                angle of incidence is 90°, the cosine of this angle will be 0.0, so the lighting

            <p>Now that we know what we need to compute, the question becomes how to compute it.
                Specifically, this means how to compute the angle of incidence for the light, but it
                also means where to perform the lighting computations.</p>
            <p>Since our mesh geometry is made of triangles, each individual triangle is flat.
                Therefore, much like the plane above, each triangle faces a single direction. This
                direction is called the <em class="glossterm">surface normal</em> or
                    <em class="glossterm">normal.</em> It is the direction that the surface is facing at
                the location of interest.</p>
            <p>Every point along the surface of a single triangle has the same geometric surface
                normal. That's all well and good, for actual triangles. But polygonal models are
                usually supposed to be approximations of real, curved surfaces. If we use the actual
                triangle's surface normal for all of the points on a triangle, the object would look
                very faceted. This would certainly be an accurate representation of the actual
                triangular mesh, but it reveals the surface to be exactly what it is: a triangular
                mesh approximation of a curved surface. If we want to create the illusion that the
                surface really is curved, we need to do something else.</p>
            <p>Instead of using the triangle's normal, we can assign to each vertex the normal
                that it <span class="emphasis"><em>would</em></span> have had on the surface it is approximating. That
                is, while the mesh is an approximation, the normal for a vertex is the actual normal
                for that surface. This actually works out surprisingly well.</p>
            <p>This means that we must add to the vertex's information. In past tutorials, we
                have had a position and sometimes a color. To that information, we add a normal. So
                we will need a vertex attribute that represents the normal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp7522"></a>Gouraud Shading</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>So each vertex has a normal. That is useful, but it is not sufficient, for one
                simple reason. We do not draw the vertices of triangles; we draw the interior of a
                triangle through rasterization.</p>
            <p>There are several ways to go about computing lighting across the surface of a
                triangle. The simplest to code, and most efficient for rendering, is to perform the
                lighting computations at every vertex, and then let the result of this computation
                be interpolated across the surface of the triangle. This process is called
                    <em class="glossterm">Gouraud shading.</em></p>
            <p>Gouraud shading is a pretty decent approximation, when using the diffuse lighting
                model. It usually looks OK so long as we remain using that lighting model, and was
                commonly used for a good decade or so. Interpolation of vertex outputs is a very
                fast process, and not having to compute lighting at every fragment generated from
                the triangle raises the performance substantially.</p>
            <p>That being said, modern games have essentially abandoned this technique. Part of
                that is because the per-fragment computation is not as slow and limited as it used to
                be. And part of it is simply that games tend to not use just diffuse lighting
                anymore, so the Gouraud approximation is more noticeably inaccurate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp7529"></a>Directional Light Source</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>The angle of incidence is the angle between the surface normal and the direction
                towards the light. Computing the direction from the point in question to the light
                can be done in a couple of ways.</p>
            <p>If you have a light source that is very close to an object, then the direction
                towards the light can change dramatically over the surface of that object. As the
                light source is moved farther and farther away, the direction towards the light
                varies less and less over the surface of the object.</p>
            <div class="figure"><a name="idp7533"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.5. Near and Far Lights</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
                
                <div class="mediaobject"><img src="NearVsFarLight.svg" alt="Near and Far Lights"></div>
            </div></div><br class="figure-break">
            <p>If the light source is sufficiently distant, relative to the size of the scene
                being rendered, then the direction towards the light is nearly the same for every
                point on every object you render. Since the direction is the same everywhere, the
                light can be represented as just a single direction given to all of the objects.
                There is no need to compute the direction based on the position of the point being
                illuminated.</p>
            <p>This situation is called a <em class="glossterm">directional light source.</em> Light
                from such a source effectively comes from a particular direction as a wall of
                intensity, evenly distributed over the scene.</p>
            <p>Direction light sources are a good model for lights like the sun relative to a
                small region of the Earth. It would not be a good model for the sun relative to the
                rest of the solar system. So scale is important.</p>
            <p>Light sources do not have to be physical objects rendered in the scene. All we
                need to use a directional light is to provide a direction to our lighting model when
                rendering the surface we want to see. However, having light appear from seemingly
                nothing hurts verisimilitude; this should be avoided where possible.</p>

            <p>Normals have many properties that positions do. Normals are vector directions, so
                like position vectors, they exist in a certain coordinate system. It is usually a
                good idea to have the normals for your vertices be in the same coordinate system as
                the positions in those vertices. So that means model space.</p>
            <p>This also means that normals must be transformed from model space to another
                space. That other space needs to be the same space that the lighting direction is
                in; otherwise, the two vectors cannot be compared. One might think that world space
                is a fine choice. After all, the light direction is already defined in world
                space.</p>
            <p>You certainly could use world space to do lighting. However, for our purposes, we
                will use camera space. The reason for this is partially illustrative: in later
                tutorials, we are going to do lighting in some rather unusual spaces. By using
                camera space, it gets us in the habit of transforming both our light direction and
                the surface normals into different spaces.</p>
            <p>We will talk more in later sections about exactly how we transform the normal. For
                now, we will just transform it with the regular transformation matrix.</p>

            <p>The full lighting model for computing the diffuse reflectance from directional
                light sources, using per-vertex normals and Gouraud shading, is as follows. The
                light will be represented by a direction and a light intensity (color). The light
                direction passed to our shader is expected to be in camera space already, so the
                shader is not responsible for this transformation. For each vertex (in addition to
                the normal position transform), we:</p>

            <p>This is what we do in the <span class="propername">Basic Lighting</span>
                tutorial. It renders a cylinder above a flat plane, with a single directional light
                source illuminating both objects. One of the nice things about a cylinder is that it
                has both curved and flat surfaces, thus making an adequate demonstration of how
                light interacts with a surface.</p>

            <p>The light is at a fixed direction; the model and camera both can be
                rotated.</p>
            <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Mouse Movement</b></p></div></div></div>
                
                <p>This is the first tutorial that uses mouse movement to orient objects and the
                    camera. These controls will be used throughout the rest of this book.</p>
                <p>The camera can be oriented with the left mouse button. Left-clicking and
                    dragging will rotate the camera around the target point. This will rotate both
                    horizontally and vertically. Think of the world as a sphere. Starting to drag
                    means placing your finger on the sphere. Moving your mouse is like moving your
                    finger; the sphere rotates along with your finger's movement. If you hold
                        <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span> when you left-click, you can rotate either
                    horizontally or vertically, depending on the direction you move the mouse.
                    Whichever direction is farthest from the original location clicked will be the
                    axis that is rotated.</p>
                <p>The camera's up direction can be changed as well. To do this, left-click while
                    holding <span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>. Only horizontal movements of the mouse will spin
                    the view. Moving left spins counter-clockwise, while moving right spins
                    clockwise.</p>
                <p>The camera can be moved closer to it's target point and farther away. To do
                    this, scroll the mouse wheel up and down. Up scrolls move closer, while down
                    moves farther away.</p>
                <p>The object can be controlled by the mouse as well. The object can be oriented
                    with the right-mouse button. Right-clicking and dragging will rotate the object
                    horizontally and vertically, relative to the current camera view. As with camera
                    controls, holding <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span> when you right-click will allow you to
                    rotate horizontally or vertically only.</p>
                <p>The object can be spun by right-clicking while holding <span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>.
                    As with the other object movements, the spin is relative to the current
                    direction of the camera.</p>
                <p>The code for these are contained in the Unofficial SDK's GL Util library.
                    Specifically, the objects <span class="type">glutil::ViewPole</span> and
                        <span class="type">glutil::ObjectPole</span>. The source code in them is, outside of how
                    FreeGLUT handles mouse input, nothing that has not been seen previously.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>Spacebar</strong></span> will switch between a cylinder that has a
                varying diffuse color and one that is pure white. This demonstrates the effect of
                lighting on a changing diffuse color.</p>
            <p>The initialization code does the usual: loads the shaders, gets uniforms from
                them, and loads a number of meshes. In this case, it loads a mesh for the ground
                plane and a mesh for the cylinder. Both of these meshes have normals at each vertex;
                we'll look at the mesh data a bit later.</p>
            <p>The display code has gone through a few changes. The vertex shader uses only two
                matrices: one for model-to-camera, and one for camera-to-clip-space. So our matrix
                stack will have the camera matrix at the very bottom.</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp7589"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 9.1. Display Camera Code</b></p><div class="example-contents">
                
                <pre class="programlisting">glutil::MatrixStack modelMatrix;

            <p>Since our vertex shader will be doing all of its lighting computations in camera
                space, we need to move the <code class="varname">g_lightDirection</code> from world space to
                camera space. So we multiply it by the camera matrix. Notice that the camera matrix
                now comes from the MousePole object.</p>
            <p>Now, we need to talk a bit about vector transforms with matrices. When
                transforming positions, the fourth component was 1.0; this was used so that the
                translation component of the matrix transformation would be added to each
                position.</p>
            <p>Normals represent directions, not absolute positions. And while rotating or
                scaling a direction is a reasonable operation, translating it is not. Now, we could
                just adjust the matrix to remove all translations before transforming our light into
                camera space. But that's highly unnecessary; we can simply put 0.0 in the fourth
                component of the direction. This will do the same job, only we do not have to mess
                with the matrix to do so.</p>
            <p>This also allows us to use the same transformation matrix for vectors as for
                positions.</p>
            <p>We upload the camera-space light direction to the two programs.</p>
            <p>To render the ground plane, we run this code:</p>
            <div class="example"><a name="idp7599"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 9.2. Ground Plane Lighting</b></p><div class="example-contents">

            <p>We upload two matrices. One of these is used for normals, and the other is used
                for positions. The normal matrix is only 3x3 instead of the usual 4x4. This is
                because normals do not use the translation component. We could have used the trick
                we used earlier, where we use a 0.0 as the W component of a 4 component normal. But
                instead, we just extract the top-left 3x3 area of the model-to-camera matrix and
                send that.</p>
            <p>Of course, the matrix is the same as the model-to-camera, except for the lack of
                translation. The reason for having separate matrices will come into play
                later.</p>
            <p>We also upload the intensity of the light, as a pure-white light at full
                brightness. Then we render the mesh.</p>

            <p>The cylinder is not scaled at all. It is one unit from top to bottom, and the
                diameter of the cylinder is also 1. Translating it up by 0.5 simply moves it to
                being on top of the ground plane. Then we apply a rotation to it, based on user
                inputs.</p>
            <p>We actually draw two different kinds of cylinders, based on user input. The
                colored cylinder is tinted red and is the initial cylinder. The white cylinder uses
                a vertex program that does not use per-vertex colors for the diffuse color; instead,
                it uses a hard-coded color of full white. These both come from the same mesh file,

            <p>There are two vertex shaders used in this tutorial. One of them uses a color
                vertex attribute as the diffuse color, and the other assumes the diffuse color is
                (1, 1, 1, 1). Here is the vertex shader that uses the color attribute,

            <p>We define a single output variable, <code class="varname">interpColor</code>, which will be
                interpolated across the surface of the triangle. We have a uniform for the
                camera-space lighting direction <code class="varname">dirToLight</code>. Notice the name: it
                is the direction from the surface <span class="emphasis"><em>towards</em></span> the light. It is not
                the direction <span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> the light.</p>
            <p>We also have a light intensity uniform value, as well as two matrices for
                positions and a separate one for normals. Notice that the
                    <code class="varname">cameraToClipMatrix</code> is in a uniform block. This allows us to
                update all programs that use the projection matrix just by changing the buffer
                object.</p>
            <p>The first line of <code class="function">main</code> simply does the position transforms we
                need to position our vertices, as we have seen before. We do not need to store the
                camera-space position, so we can do the entire transformation in a single
                step.</p>
            <p>The next line takes our normal and transforms it by the model-to-camera matrix
                specifically for normals. As noted earlier, the contents of this matrix are
                identical to the contents of <code class="varname">modelToCameraMatrix.</code> The
                    <code class="function">normalize</code> function takes the result of the transform and
                ensures that the normal has a length of one. The need for this will be explained
                later.</p>
            <p>We then compute the cosine of the angle of incidence. We'll explain how this math
                computes this shortly. Do note that after computing the cosine of the angle of
                incidence, we then clamp the value to between 0 and 1 using the GLSL built-in
                function <code class="function">clamp.</code></p>
            <p>This is important, because the cosine of the angle of incidence can be negative.
                This is for values which are pointed directly away from the light, such as the
                underside of the ground plane, or any part of the cylinder that is facing away from
                the light. The lighting computations do not make sense with this value being
                negative, so the clamping is necessary.</p>
            <p>After computing that value, we multiply it by the light intensity and diffuse
                color. This result is then passed to the interpolated output color. The fragment
                shader is a simple passthrough shader that writes the interpolated color
                directly.</p>
            <p>The version of the vertex shader without the per-vertex color attribute simply
                omits the multiplication with the <code class="varname">diffuseColor</code> (as well as the
                definition of that input variable). This is the same as doing a multiply with a
                color vector of all 1.0.</p>

            <p>We glossed over an important point in looking at the vertex shader. Namely, how
                the cosine of the angle of incidence is computed.</p>
            <p>Given two vectors, one could certainly compute the angle of incidence, then take
                the cosine of it. But both computing that angle and taking its cosine are quite
                expensive. Instead, we elect to use a vector math trick: the <em class="glossterm">vector dot
                    product.</em></p>
            <p>The vector dot product between two vectors can be mathematically computed as

            <p>If both vectors have a length of one (ie: they are unit vectors), then the result
                of a dot product is just the cosine of the angle between the vectors.</p>
            <p>This is also part of the reason why the light direction is the direction
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>towards</em></span> the light rather than from the light. Otherwise we
                would have to negate the vector before performing the dot product.</p>
            <p>What makes this faster than taking the cosine of the angle directly is that, while
                the dot product is geometrically the cosine of the angle between the two unit
                vectors, computing the dot product via vector math is very simple:</p>
